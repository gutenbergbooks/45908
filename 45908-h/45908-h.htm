<div class='adtitle2'>Peggy Raymond's Way</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>WHAT'S IN A NAME?</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first day of the spring vacation,
and Amy Lassell had spent it sewing. To be
frank, it had not measured up to her idea of a
holiday. Self-indulgence was Amy's besetting
weakness. Her dearest friend, Peggy Raymond,
was never happy unless she was busy at
something, but Amy loved the luxury of idleness.</p>

<p>Yet although indolence appealed so strongly
to Amy's temperament, to do her justice she
was generally able to turn a deaf ear to its
call. The first summer after America's entry
into the war she had enlisted in the Land Army
along with Peggy and Priscilla, and then in the
fall had taken up her work at the local Red
Cross headquarters, serving in an unpaid position
as conscientiously as if she had received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
salary and was depending on it for her bread
and butter.</p>

<p>After a strenuous year with the Red Cross,
Amy had entered college with Ruth Wylie.
Neither girl had expected to enter till after the
close of the war, and Amy was continually
harping upon the respect which the young and
unsophisticated Freshmen were bound to feel
for classmates of such advanced years. But
Nelson Hallowell's discharge from the service
had altered the aspect of affairs. Ruth had
pledged herself to keep Nelson's position for
him till he should return, and Amy had
promised to wait for Ruth. The wound which
had kept Nelson in the hospital less than a
month had nevertheless incapacitated him from
military service. Heavy-hearted, he had returned
to his job at the book store, while Ruth
and Amy had immediately made their plans for
entering college just two years behind Peggy
and Priscilla.</p>

<p>After her months of hard study, the first day
of the spring vacation found Amy at the sewing
machine, which in itself was sufficient proof
that, whatever her natural bias in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of indolence, her will was more than a match
for that tendency. As a matter of fact she was
the only one of the Friendly Terrace quartette
to spend the day in unremitting industry.
Peggy and Ruth had gone off with Graham for
the day. Priscilla was entertaining an out-of-town
guest. But Amy, resolution manifest in
every line of her plump little figure, was sewing
for dear life.</p>

<p>Though the armistice had been signed
months before, there still remained foes to
fight, as the girls had promptly discovered.
The reaction from economy and hard work had
come in the shape of an orgy of extravagance
and frivolity. The high war prices were continually
going higher, as dealers realized that
people would get what they wanted regardless
of price. The four Friendly Terrace girls,
after an afternoon of shopping which had
ended in the purchase of a box of hair-pins and
two spools of thread, had returned home to hold
a council of war.</p>

<p>"The only way to bring prices down is to
stop buying things," declared Peggy, with all
the authority of a college Junior. "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
know as I have anything to make over, but if I
have, nothing new for me this spring."</p>

<p>Amy sighed. "I'd just been luxuriating in
the thought of a lot of new dresses," she said
mournfully. "Don't you know how after
you've been dieting, all at once you're hungry
for creamed chicken and pineapple fritters, and
chocolate with whipped cream, and strawberry
sundaes, all rolled into one. And that's just
the way I feel about clothes. But I suppose it
will end in my making over my blue taffeta."</p>

<p>"I've two or three summer dresses that will
do very well if I make the skirts scanty,"
said Ruth. "They're too full for this season."</p>

<p>They talked on seriously, planning their
little economies as if they expected unaided to
bring down the high cost of living. They were
not the sort of girls who follow the crowd unthinkingly,
nor had any of them contracted the
fatal habit of asking, "What can one do?"
The program they outlined would have resulted
in a general lowering of prices in a month's
time if every one had agreed to it. And it did
not occur to them that public indifference excused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them from doing their little part toward
combating a serious evil.</p>

<p>That was how it happened that Amy Lassell
had spent the spring day sewing. The blue
taffeta had been ripped and pressed in anticipation
of the vacation leisure, and as soon as
the breakfast dishes were out of the way Amy
had commandeered the dining-room table as
a cutting table. With the help of a paper
pattern she had remodeled the taffeta according
to the latest dictates of fashion.
Caution suggested that it would be advisable
to wait for assistance in the fitting, but having
basted the breadths together and surveyed her
reflection in the mirror, Amy had been so
favorably impressed that she had gone to work
energetically stitching up seams.</p>

<p>Like many people whose natural tendency is
in the direction of indolence, Amy was capable
of relentless industry, almost as though she
were afraid that if once she halted she might
not get her courage to the point of starting
again. She swallowed a hasty luncheon and
rushed back to her sewing. Her eyes grew
tired, her back ached. She became nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and hot and impatient, so that breaking a
thread or dropping a thimble seemed almost a
calamity. And yet she did not stop.</p>

<p>It was after five when she laid her work
reluctantly aside. Amy's responsibilities for
the day were not limited to the blue taffeta.
As in many another household, the domestic
service problem had become acute in the
Lassell establishment during the last few
years. Incapable servants demanding preposterous
wages, had been replaced by others
equally incompetent, and there had been
interims when it had been difficult to secure so
much as a laundress. Amy and her mother
had learned a good many short cuts to achievement,
and had accepted the frequent necessity
of doing their own work with a philosophy of
which they would have been incapable in pre-war
times. On this first day of vacation Amy
was without a servant, and without a mother,
as well; for Mrs. Lassell had left home that
morning not to return till nearly bed-time.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the realization that she must
prepare her father's supper forced itself on
Amy's attention. It was not a formidable responsibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for at breakfast that morning Mr.
Lassell had informed her that he was to take
a customer out to lunch and would be satisfied
with very little for the evening meal. Amy
meant to take him at his word. There was
cold meat, quite enough for two, she thought;
and some potatoes to fry, and her father did
not care much for dessert. Accordingly,
Amy had waited till five o'clock before she
laid down her sewing, and then she realized
for the first time how very tired she was. A
glimpse of herself in the mirror emphasized her
certainty that it was high time to stop. Amy's
fair hair was disheveled, her plump cheeks
brilliantly pink. There were dark lines under
her eyes, eloquent of weariness. Amy regarded
herself with extreme disfavor.</p>

<p>"Looks as if I'd taken up rouge in my old
age. And I positively must do my hair over. I
can't ask even poor patient daddy to look at
such a frowsy head all through supper. O, well,
he won't mind, if I am a little late."</p>

<p>Encouraging herself with this reflection, Amy
bathed her burning cheeks, combed her hair hastily,
and slipped into a little gingham gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
which, if somewhat faded and passée, had at
least the merit of being fresh and clean. It buttoned
in the back, and by virtue of much twisting
and stretching Amy finally succeeded in securing
the middle button which for a time had
defied her efforts. And just as she did so, the
door-bell rang.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/facing008.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="Woman welcoming another man nad woman" />
<div class="caption">"'COME RIGHT IN,' SAID AMY WITH A MISLEADING AIR
OF CORDIALITY"</div>
</div>

<p>Amy went placidly downstairs. She had no
apprehensions about the door-bell. She took it
for granted that it was somebody to collect for
the newspaper, or an old-clothes man, or else a
friend so intimate that she could ask her into
the kitchen while she made her supper preparations.
As she reached the door she realized her
mistake. Of the two young people waiting admission
she had met the sister several times.
The brother she knew merely by sight, for the
family had moved into the neighborhood only
recently.</p>

<p>For a moment Amy's mood was one of unqualified
dismay. She wanted to turn and run.
With lightning-like rapidity she compared her
faded gingham with the stylish frock setting off
the girlish, graceful figure of Hildegarde Carey.
And Hildegarde's brother, Robert, if looking a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>trifle bored, was immaculately attired. Amy
recollected that in her absorption with the blue
taffeta she had neglected to dust the living room
that morning.</p>

<p>Amy opened the door with a smile that poorly
concealed her anguish of spirit. Her flickering
hope that Hildegarde had made a mistake in the
number was dissipated by the composure of
Hildegarde's greeting. The two young people
entered, as Amy realized, without waiting to be
asked, and in the hall Hildegarde performed the
ceremony of introduction.</p>

<p>"Come right in," said Amy with a misleading
air of cordiality. She wondered if she had
better apologize for the undusted living room,
but decided against it. Perhaps they would
overlook it, though Robert Carey impressed her
as one who would notice the least little thing
out of the way. Amy decided that the young
fellow's handsome face was almost spoiled by
its discontented expression.</p>

<p>Another shock came when she said to Hildegarde,
"Let me take your coat." She expected
Hildegarde to reply that the coat was light and
that she did not mind it for the few minutes she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
had to stay; but on the contrary she not only removed
her coat, but slipped off her gloves, unpinned
her hat, and added it to the collection
Amy carried into the hall with a growing sense
of stupefaction. "Any one would think," she
told herself, "that she was an old friend come
to spend the day."</p>

<p>Perhaps Amy's perplexity partly explained
the fact that the next half hour dragged. Amy
was not her usual entertaining self. She
thought of the dust showing gray against the
shining mahogany of the piano. She thought of
her faded gingham. She heard herself talking
stupidly, unnaturally, and chiefly about the
weather. Robert Carey looked more bored than
ever.</p>

<p>At half past six her father came in. He
glanced at the group in the living room as he
entered, and Amy hastily summoned him. Her
guests must realize that when the man of the
house came home it was time to leave. Amy
introduced her father, pulled out an arm chair
invitingly, and Mr. Lassell seated himself. It
was from him that his daughter had inherited
her sense of humor, and on this occasion he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
made himself much more entertaining than
Amy had done. The conversation became almost
animated.</p>

<p>The clock in the hall struck seven, tolling out
the notes sonorously. Every one seemed to be
listening to it, and Amy flushed. It was almost
as if the clock had said, "Time to go home!
Time to go home!" And then to her horror
her father turned toward her inquiringly.
"Hadn't you better put on the supper, my
dear?" he asked. "Your friends will be getting
hungry."</p>

<p>For an agonized half minute Amy vainly
tried to think of something she could say to
soften the blow. She was magnanimous enough
to acquit her father of all blame. Seeing them
sitting there at that hour, especially as Hildegarde
had taken off her hat, he had innocently
assumed that they had been invited to dinner.
And of course his blunder was equivalent to
saying that they had stayed longer than was
proper or desirable.</p>

<p>Then Amy's head whirled again. Her guests
did not spring to their feet as she had expected
them to do, protesting that they had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dreamed it was so late. Instead they sat quite
still, only murmuring a polite disclaimer of
being hungry. With the force of a blow the
realization came over Amy that they had accepted
her father's tacit invitation. They were
going to stay to supper.</p>

<p>Amy rose, murmuring something unintelligible,
and got out of the room quickly. O, if
Peggy were only home, Peggy who had such a
faculty for evolving something savory and appetizing
from the least promising materials.
Amy's cooking until recently had been confined
to chafing-dish delicacies and candy. It was
too late, she realized, to add to her scanty
stores. She must feed four people with what
had seemed barely enough for two, and must
do it quickly.</p>

<p>Mechanically she lighted the oven of the gas
stove. She remembered there was a can of tomato
soup in the house, and the cold meat,
sliced very thin, might possibly pass muster.
She herself would refuse meat. Luckily there
was a generous plateful of potatoes. Creamed
and with a little cheese grated over them, they
would be appetizing&mdash;and filling. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
make baking powder biscuit,&mdash;Amy excelled in
baking powder biscuit&mdash;and there was honey
to eat with them. For dessert she would fall
back on preserved peaches and some left-over
fruit cake. It was a queer, hit-or-miss meal,
not a company repast in any sense of the word,
but the best she could do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It was while the biscuits were browning in
the oven, and Amy was hastily setting the table
for four, that her native common-sense re-asserted
itself. "After all," her thoughts ran,
"if people take pot luck, they can't expect to
find things just as they would be if they were
especially invited. They've seemed real
friendly and if they like me well enough to stay
to a pick-up supper, the first time they've ever
set foot in my home, I ought to meet them half
way. I can't give them much to eat, but I don't
need to be quite as stupid as I've been for the
last hour."</p>

<p>And so it came about that when the guests
were summoned to the dining room, they encountered
a very different hostess from the one
who had entertained them previously, a hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
who twinkled and sparkled and kept them
laughing. It seemed to Amy that, when she
had removed the soup plates and brought in the
sliced meat and creamed potatoes, she had seen
an expression of astonishment flicker across
Hildegarde's face, but she resolutely put the
thought aside and continued to make herself
agreeable. The baking-powder biscuits had
risen nobly to the occasion. Amy thought
them the best she had ever made. And she
saw with relief that the bored expression had
disappeared from Robert Carey's face, and
that he really seemed to be enjoying himself.</p>

<p>Then suddenly into the midst of all this
gaiety, Hildegarde dropped a bomb in the
shape of a question. "What happened to detain
Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Isabel Vincent, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," Amy hesitated, "that I don't
know any one of that name."</p>

<p>Apparently the meal had come to a full stop.
"Why," Hildegarde cried, "the Isabel Vincent
who attended the Pelham school when I
was there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>She was so insistent that Amy unconsciously
became apologetic. "I'm sorry but I
can't say I remember such a girl. Did she
ever say she had met me?"</p>

<p>"Why," Hildegarde almost screamed,
"didn't you ask us here to-night to meet her?"</p>

<p>"To meet Isabel Vincent! Why, I never
heard of her."</p>

<p>"There's some mistake," exclaimed Robert.
He had just helped himself to a fifth baking-powder
biscuit, but he laid it down unbuttered.
"You've made some mistake," he informed his
sister.</p>

<p>Hildegarde ignored him and addressed herself
to Amy. "Didn't you telephone me this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;why, to tell the truth, no I didn't."</p>

<p>"Then it was a disgusting practical joke.
Some one called me up about eleven o'clock and
said she was Amy Lassell, and that Isabel Vincent
was to stop here twenty-four hours on her
way to New York from her home in Chicago.
And then she invited Bob and me to dinner to
meet Isabel. There wasn't anything in her
manner to give me an idea it was a hoax."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>But Amy had found the clew. "O, did Isabel
come from Chicago?" she cried. "Then I
know. It was Avery Zall who telephoned you."</p>

<p>"But I don't know her."</p>

<p>"She went away to boarding school&mdash;yes, it
was the Pelham school, I'm sure. And I know
she has a friend from Chicago visiting her.
Probably the Vincent girl spoke of knowing
you, and Avery called you up. O, dear!"
groaned Amy with a sudden change of countenance.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Bob Carey,
still ignoring his biscuit.</p>

<p>"I've cheated you out of a regular feast.
The Zalls have a wonderful cook. You'd have
had broiled chicken and fresh mushrooms and
I don't know what beside, and I've given you
cold meat and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've given us the best biscuits I ever
ate," said Bob, and buttered his fifth, but his
sister had turned pale.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any one ever did such a
dreadful thing before. Here we descended on
you without warning and simply forced you to
invite us to stay&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Happy escape, I think," said Bob. "If
there's anything I hate, it's these social stunts
Hildegarde's crazy about."</p>

<p>"The only dreadful part," said Amy, reassuring
the distressed Hildegarde, "is that
you've exchanged a perfectly gorgeous dinner
for a pick-up supper."</p>

<p>"But what must Miss&mdash;Miss Zall think of
me?"</p>

<p>"She must know there's some mistake.
Probably they're not waiting dinner any longer,
for it's after eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"O," groaned Hildegarde, "I never was so
mortified. What am I going to do?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me you'd better finish your supper,
such as it is," suggested Amy. "And then
you can call up Avery Zall and explain your
mistake. She'll see that the names sound alike
over the phone. And after that there'll be
plenty of time to see your friends."</p>

<p>"Seems to me," suggested Bob, "that as
long as we've started the evening here, we
might as well put it through."</p>

<p>His eyes met Amy's with a twinkle that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
like a spark to tinder. Amy struggled for a
moment, then gave way to peals of laughter.</p>

<p>"O," she gasped, when at length she could
find her voice, "What must you have thought
of me, inviting you to dinner and then coming
down in this old, faded gingham."</p>

<p>"And what must you have thought of <i>me</i>,"
Hildegarde cried, "coming at such an hour and
calmly taking off my hat."</p>

<p>"The dust was thick over everything,"
giggled Amy. "I've been sewing every minute
all day long, and I warned father to expect a
light meal."</p>

<p>"I should have known I had made a mistake,"
Hildegarde lamented, "when you never
said a word about Isabel. I don't know how
I could have been so ridiculously stupid."</p>

<p>But for all her dismay, she laughed. Indeed
if laughter aids digestion, there was little
danger that Amy's biscuits would disagree
with any one, even Robert, who had dispatched
such an extravagant number.</p>

<p>While Amy cleared the table and brought in
the dessert, Hildegarde went to the phone and
explained matters to a young woman whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
preliminary stiffness melted as Hildegarde reviewed
the situation. And then Hildegarde
hurried back to inform her brother that they
must go over as soon as he had finished. "She
was as sweet as she could be, but she said
they had waited dinner an hour."</p>

<p>"So it's up to you to 'gobble and git,'"
quoted Amy, dishing out the preserves with a
lavish hand.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be hurried over that fruit
cake," declared Bob. "It carries me back to
the merry Christmas time."</p>

<p>"It ought to, for it's a Christmas cake, but
it's been kept in a tin box with an apple and I
hope it isn't dry. It was all I had in the cake
line." Amy paused to laugh again. "I really
must stop," she exclaimed, wiping her moist
eyes. "They say that laughing at meal-time
makes one fat, and I don't dare risk another
pound."</p>

<p>"Can't have too much of a good thing," declared
Bob Carey with a significant glance at
the flushed face. Strictly speaking, Amy was
perhaps the least pretty of the four Friendly
Terrace girls; but good humor has a charm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a face radiant with fun can hold its own against
discontented beauty any day. There was such
frank admiration in the look the young man
bent upon her, that Amy's cheeks grew hot with
an unwonted self-consciousness.</p>

<p>The brother and sister left with evident reluctance.
"Now we've had dinner with you,"
said Hildegarde, "you must dine with us very
soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, this doesn't deserve to be counted,"
Amy laughed. "I'll ask you again some day
and show you what I can do if I really try."</p>

<p>"No, don't," pleaded Bob. "Have us again
when you're going to have biscuit. It's so
much jollier to be informal than to work the
society racket." And then Hildegarde carried
him off, protesting that, if they didn't hurry,
Avery Zall would not believe a word of her
excuse.</p>

<p>Amy found her father clearing the table.
She put on her long apron and joined him, chattering
excitedly as she worked.</p>

<p>"No full garbage can to-night, Daddy. Every
dish is scraped clean. I suppose I ought to
feel crushed over setting such a meal before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
people I hardly knew, but somehow I don't."</p>

<p>Her father smiling, responsive to her high
spirits, shook his head.</p>

<p>"It isn't much to set good food before folks,
Amy. Any waiter in a restaurant can do that.
Give people the best of yourself and you don't
need to worry about your bill of fare."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>A TELEPHONE PARTY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">However</span> much the rest of the year may drag,
the spring vacation always ignores the speed
limit. What with dress-making and shopping,
and going over one's bureau drawers and closets
in anticipation of the spring cleaning, and
trying to do the things one has been postponing
till this week of leisure, and taking advantage
of all the pleasures that start up like mushrooms,
twenty-four hours in a day are all too
few. When Priscilla dropped in on Peggy to
suggest going out into the country for wild
flowers, the Monday afternoon that closed the
holiday season, Peggy hesitated.</p>

<p>"I'd love it. I don't feel that spring is
really here until I have picked a few violets and
spring beauties. But I was thinking of going
to see Mary Donaldson."</p>

<p>"Why, is anything the matter?" Priscilla
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy stared, "Matter! You know that since
that attack of inflammatory rheumatism she
hasn't walked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I meant anything new."</p>

<p>"O, there's nothing <i>new</i>, not as far as I
know. I haven't been in to see Mary since&mdash;O,
dear, I'm afraid it's been an age."</p>

<p>"I only meant," explained Priscilla reasonably,
"that if Mary's no worse off than she has
been for the last year and a half, there's no
especial point in taking to-day to go to see her.
You could go any afternoon."</p>

<p>"I could," owned Peggy with a significant
inflection.</p>

<p>"And it's such a perfect day to go after wild
flowers."</p>

<p>Peggy looked from the window. The blue
sky seemed to smile an invitation. Priscilla's
argument all at once appeared unanswerable.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it lovely!" Peggy drew a long
breath. "Too lovely to stay indoors. I'll go
to see Mary some stormy afternoon when she
needs cheering up."</p>

<p>And now that her decision was made, the
thought of Mary Donaldson passed completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from Peggy's mind. She had never been particularly
intimate with this class-mate, and had
it not been for Mary's illness it is unlikely
that the two girls would have seen much of each
other after high school days. But the winter of
Peggy's Freshman year, an attack of rheumatism
had left Mary seriously crippled.
Though now she was able to be dressed and to
hobble from her bed to a chair by the window,
getting downstairs was too difficult a process
to be considered, except on very especial occasions.
With all the yearnings for life and
joy that characterize the normal girl, Mary
was condemned to vibrate between her bed and
chair.</p>

<p>It was not strange that with all her sympathy
Peggy had found it difficult to see much
of her invalid friend. The demands made by
the war upon the scanty leisure of a college
student left her little time she could call her
own. She had worked making surgical dressings
under the Red Cross, and had given much
time to collecting and mending worn garments
for the destitute children of Belgium and
France. She had subscribed for a bond in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the Government loans, and to pay for these
with her own earnings had required hard work
and careful financing. On the whole, though
Peggy was sorry not to have seen more of
Mary Donaldson, her conscience acquitted her
of neglect.</p>

<p>The season was advanced and the girls had
no difficulty in filling their baskets with the
early arrivals among the wild flowers, and as
their baskets filled, they feasted their eyes on
the myriad indeterminate shades of a spring
landscape, and drank in the exhilarating odors
of damp earth, warmed by the April sun.
When Peggy's wrist-watch warned them it was
time to start for home, they went reluctantly,
with an unreasonable feeling that in returning
to town they were leaving the spring behind
them.</p>

<p>At their transfer point a sign in a drug store
window caught Amy's eye. "Ice cream soda
with fresh fruit," she read impressively. "I
wondered what it was I wanted. I've lost a
pound and a half since vacation began, so I
dare to risk one."</p>

<p>"I haven't been buying sodas, because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
needed the money for something else," said
Peggy. "But this is the last day of vacation
and I believe I'll celebrate."</p>

<p>They filed in and gave their orders. Peggy
had just taken the first sip of a ravishing concoction,
whose formula would have given a
dyspeptic heart-failure, when at the opposite
counter she spied a stout, middle-aged woman
who was regarding her with savage intentness.
Her features were familiar, in spite of a look
of hostility Peggy was not accustomed to see
on the faces that looked in her direction.</p>

<p>For some minutes Peggy was frankly
puzzled. Not till she was finishing her soda
did she remember where she had seen that
heavy, lowering face before. But with the
recollection, she slipped from her stool and
crossed to the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to think where I've seen
you before, but now I remember. You're the
Miss Potts who takes care of Mary Donaldson,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>Rather ungraciously Miss Potts admitted her
identity. She was not a trained nurse, for in
Mary's case skilled hands were no longer necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Miss Potts was big and strong and kind
of heart, though at the moment her expression
was far from suggesting the latter characteristic.
A little puzzled by the woman's manner,
Peggy continued, "I've been wanting to see
Mary for ever so long. How is she?"</p>

<p>"Well, she ain't doing very well, and no wonder.
Old folks get kind of used to the way
things are in this world, and it doesn't surprise
'em none to be forgotten. But it's sort of hard
on the young."</p>

<p>Peggy flushed hotly. She realized that Miss
Potts' disagreeable manner was a deliberate
expression of resentment. "I'm sorry that I
haven't been able to see more of Mary this
last year," she said with gentle dignity, "but
I've been very busy, and it's such a long way
over here."</p>

<p>"I s'pose it's a long way to your telephone,
too."</p>

<p>"Telephone!" Peggy repeated. She looked
at Miss Potts so blankly that Mary's caretaker
had no alternative but to explain.</p>

<p>"Her pa had it put in for a surprise. It's
right beside her bed, and the little thing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stands on moves 'round, so she can talk without
any trouble. He thought it would be a
comfort to her, for she could chat with all
her friends, and sort of keep up with
things."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Peggy, feeling uncomfortable.
"I should think she'd get lots of fun
out of it." She was remembering that Mary
had called her up&mdash;it was weeks or months, or
was it fully a year before&mdash;to tell her about
the new telephone. There had been an eagerness
in Mary's voice that she remembered vividly.
Peggy had agreed that it was "splendid,"
without realizing just what this link with
the outside world would mean to a girl shut out
from so much.</p>

<p>Miss Potts indulged in an unmusical laugh.
"Oh, yes," she said. "She gets lots of fun.
Every now and then she gets a call. There's
so many new girls on the telephone exchanges
nowadays, that they're bound to give her number
every little while. And then she tells 'em
it's the wrong number and rings off."</p>

<p>Peggy's face was a study. "Do you mean
that she&mdash;that no one&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The aggressiveness suddenly disappeared
from Miss Potts' manner. Her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"It's the heart-breakingest thing I ever want
to see," she cried. "She was so hopeful at
first. As soon as that telephone was put in, she
called up everybody she knew, to tell 'em about
it. And then she'd lie there smiling, watching
that phone, as if it was something out of
a fairy book and was going to bring her all
kinds of happiness."</p>

<p>Peggy's imagination was a vivid one. As
Miss Potts spoke, she could almost see Mary's
smiling, expectant face. A pang of sympathy
stabbed her tender heart.</p>

<p>"The very first time that telephone rang it
was somebody that wanted the butcher; and
the second time, a girl, who was coming over
to spend the afternoon with her, rang up to say
her aunt was in town and she was going to the
matinée instead. I don't think Mary ever felt
the same about her phone after that start-out.
When it rang, she looked kind of scared, as if
she was afraid she was going to hear something
disappointing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"But surely," Peggy exclaimed, "she must
have lots of calls from her friends. I&mdash;why,
I know I haven't called very often, but that
was because I was always hoping to get time
to go over to see her." There was such genuine
distress in her voice that Miss Potts was
visibly melted.</p>

<p>"It's a busy world," she said, "for young
folks and old folks, too, and I guess on the
whole it's lucky it is so easy for us to forget.
But all the same," she ended, with a shake of
her head, "it's pretty hard on the ones who
get forgotten."</p>

<p>The clerk brought out the prescription for
which Miss Potts had been waiting, and Peggy
rejoined her friends. For a moment she considered
sending her flowers to Mary, but a fear
that to Miss Potts this might seem an effort
to evade a more exacting expression of sympathy
led her to relinquish her purpose. Her
crest-fallen manner revealed that something
was wrong, and as they left the drug store
her friends resentfully demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>"Peggy, what was that woman saying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
you?" Priscilla was bristling like a mother hen
who sees one of her brood attacked.</p>

<p>In a few words Peggy explained. Her
three listeners exchanged conscience-stricken
glances.</p>

<p>"It seems rather mean that you should be
the one to be scolded," said Amy, "when you
have gone to see Mary oftener than all the
three of us together."</p>

<p>"That isn't saying much," Peggy stated
gloomily. "I haven't been near her for
months."</p>

<p>"But you haven't had time," cried Ruth,
slipping her hand through her friend's
arm.</p>

<p>"No, I think I really haven't," Peggy said
frankly. "But I certainly have had time to go
to the telephone." Then suddenly her face
brightened. "I know what we'll do, girls; we'll
give her a telephone party."</p>

<p>"A telephone party," Amy repeated.
"What do you mean by that?" The car for
which they were waiting came along before
Peggy could answer, and she finished her explanation
hanging to a strap, while her three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
companions, similarly supported and swaying
violently with each jerk of the car, listened absorbedly.</p>

<p>"College opens to-morrow, and the first day
is never so very busy, so we'll call Mary up
every hour. My hour will be between nine and
ten. Priscilla, you take the hour between ten
and eleven; and Amy, you can have the next
one. I think we'd better omit the hour between
twelve and one, for she'll probably be eating
luncheon then. Ruth, you may call between
one and two."</p>

<p>"But you said every hour, Peggy. Don't
you think it would be rather over-doing it to
call twice in one day?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to get hold of some of the other
girls who were in Mary's class in high school,
Elinor Hewitt, and Anna Joyce, and Blanche
Eastabrook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's in New York."</p>

<p>"Well, Marian O'Neil isn't. And I'll see
Aimee Dubois at college and tell her about it.
Mary's telephone is going to work overtime to
make up for its long idleness."</p>

<p>"What I don't understand," said Priscilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
"is if Mary was so lonely, why didn't she call
us up?"</p>

<p>"I can understand that easy enough," replied
Peggy. "She called us up to tell us she had a
phone, and after that, it was our move."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," suggested Amy, "that
there isn't a great deal to talk about, when
you don't get out of an upstairs room from
one month to another."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," Priscilla acknowledged.
Everything considered, it was a rather crest-fallen
quartette of girls who returned from
their afternoon's outing.</p>

<p>It was just half past nine next day when
Mary Donaldson's telephone rang. "I'm not
too early, am I?" said a cheery voice.</p>

<p>Mary, who had taken up the receiver with
the air of uncertainty to which Miss Potts had
referred, uttered a joyful exclamation. "Why,
it's Peggy Raymond!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Peggy. I wanted to tell you
about something perfectly killing that happened
to Amy the other day." Peggy had made up
her mind to ignore the months of silence. Explanations
would not help matters, for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
could explain away the fact that in the whirl and
rush of their over-full lives they had, for the
time being, quite forgotten Mary.</p>

<p>The story of Amy's impromptu dinner party
proved as entertaining as Peggy had anticipated.
Mary Donaldson laughed as she had
not laughed for months. And in the next room
Miss Potts, listening, made strange grimaces
that seemed only distantly related to smiles.
When the story was finished, Mary had some
questions to ask. "Who are the Careys?
There used to be a Carey girl in school&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure they aren't related to her.
They come from some place in New York and
they've lived in our neighborhood less than a
year. And do you know, Mary, we think Amy
must have made quite an impression on the
brother&mdash;Bob. He's called on her twice since,
and he's asked her to go to the Glee Club concert."</p>

<p>"He has!" Romance dies hard in the heart
of a girl. Poor Mary, shut away from contact
with young life, was thrilled by the suggestion
of an incipient love-story. "Is he nice
looking?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I've not met him yet, but I've noticed
him passing several times, and I thought he
was quite handsome. And Hildegarde is an
awfully stylish girl, though I'd hardly call her
pretty."</p>

<p>In ten minutes Peggy announced that she
must go to a history lecture and rang off. She
was smiling as she went to class, and wishing
she could be an unseen listener to the conversations
scheduled to take place in Mary's room
every hour in the day.</p>

<p>As Peggy had promised, the bell of Mary's
telephone worked over-time. The Friendly
Terrace girls were supplemented by former
school-mates in sufficient numbers to keep up
the excitement till half past eight that evening.
Most of the girls, whose memories Peggy had
undertaken to jolt, were conscience-stricken
when they realized how they had neglected
Mary. And they readily fell in with Peggy's
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Even if we can't get over there very often,"
urged Peggy, "we can use the telephone. Five
minutes talk every few days will make Mary
feel that she's in touch with us still. It doesn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
seem to me I could bear feeling forgotten."
Peggy did not realize that, even with Mary's
disability, she would have made herself the center
of some circle; and in her failure to understand
that Mary's rather colorless personality
was in part responsible for what had happened,
Peggy was the more severe upon herself for
what now seemed to her inexplicable and inexcusable
neglect.</p>

<p>Thanks to the sudden activity of Peggy's
conscience, Mary Donaldson heard more outside
news in one day than she had heard in the
three months previous. And as the trouble
with most young people is want of thought,
rather than want of heart, few of the girls were
satisfied with chatting five or ten minutes over
the telephone. They promised to come to see
her soon. They offered to lend her books or
mail her magazines. One girl suggested that
she would bring over some of her victrola
records for Mary to hear, and another informed
her that as soon as the lilies of the valley were
out she should have a cluster. All at once
Mary Donaldson's friends were remembering
her in earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>When Marian O'Neil rang off at twenty
minutes of nine, Mary hesitated a moment and
then called Peggy Raymond. And Peggy who
was giving her studies that half-hearted attention
customary on the first day after vacation,
whether the student is in the primary
grade or a college Junior, came running downstairs
when Dick shouted her name.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;Hello&mdash;Why, Mary!" The pleasure
in her tone was unmistakable, and the shut-in,
two miles away, thrilled responsively.</p>

<p>"Peggy, I just wanted to tell you before I
went to sleep that I've had such a lovely day."</p>

<p>"Have you, dear? I'm glad. What happened?"</p>

<p>The question took the guileless Mary aback.
"I thought perhaps you knew something about
it. My telephone has been ringing all day. It
was queer if it was only a coincidence, for
some girls called me up that I haven't heard
from for years."</p>

<p>"Must have been what they call a brain
wave," suggested Peggy, audaciously.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, it was nice. I've heard so
many things and talked with so many people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that I feel as if I'd been to a party."</p>

<p>"If that's all, Mary, I'll prophesy there'll be
just as nice days coming as this."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so, Peggy! Well, it's
my bed time now, so I won't talk any longer.
Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night!" And as Peggy hung up the
receiver, she reflected that she had never done
justice to the possibilities of the telephone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A TRIUMPH OF ART</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of those warm, summer-like days
of early June, when lessons and college
classes are forgotten in the enjoyment of
thoughts of the summer vacation to come.
Such a few days left, and the four girls would
be free for all the reading and the tennis and
the sewing and the tramping which the press
of examination preparation had forced aside.
And they would all be together again this summer,
which gave promise of many Quartette
larks. The day was so perfect that all four had,
as if of one mind, discarded their lessons for
the remainder of the day, and had drifted over
to Amy's.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I've been thinking about
all week?" demanded Amy of the trio occupying
her front porch. She did not wait for any
of them to hazard a guess, but gave the answer
herself, "Strawberries."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A soft little murmur went the rounds. "We
had strawberries for dinner last night," said
Peggy, "the best I've tasted this year."</p>

<p>"And we had strawberry short-cake." Priscilla
smacked her lips reminiscently.</p>

<p>"And I had some strawberry ice cream at
Birds'," put in Ruth. "It was so warm along
about nine o'clock, you know, and Nelson and
I went down. My, but it was good!"</p>

<p>Amy listened unmoved. "What I've been
thinking about," she explained, "is strawberries
in the patch, sticking their heads out from
under the leaves, as if they were begging to be
picked, warm from the sun, and sweet, and just
spilling over with juice."</p>

<p>The girls sat attentive. Something in Amy's
manner indicated that there was a background
of reality for this flight of fancy.</p>

<p>"I've got a sort of relation living about ten
miles out of town," Amy continued. "Aunt
Phoebe Cummings, only that isn't her name.
Five years ago she married a man named
Frost."</p>

<p>"How interesting to get a new uncle at your
age," interjected Ruth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't regard him as much of an addition
to the family," retorted Amy drily.
"When I talk about him, I call him, 'Uncle
Philander-Behind-His-Back.' But to his face,
he's Mr. Frost. You see, Aunt Phoebe isn't
exactly an aunt. I believe she's a second
cousin of my grandfather's first wife, but she's
nicer than lots of real aunts."</p>

<p>"I do think you have the nicest relations,
Amy Lassell," interposed Peggy. "Now Aunt
Abigail, at Doolittle cottage, was a perfect
dear."</p>

<p>Priscilla showed signs of impatience. "What
has all this to do with strawberries?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm coming to that. My Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back
owns a little farm, and
they've got strawberries to burn. And almost
every year Aunt Phoebe says she wishes I'd
come out when the strawberries are ripe and
bring some of my friends."</p>

<p>"Amy Lassell!" exclaimed Priscilla reproachfully.
"Do you mean that Mrs. Philander
has been begging you to do this for the
last five years, and that this is the first we've
heard of it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, as a rule she mentions it along about
August, or October, and I forget it by June.
But she came in town to shop the other day
and took dinner with us, and when she left,
she broached the subject again. She said the
strawberries would be at their best by the
middle of next week and she'd love to meet
you all. What do you think of a trip to the
country along about Wednesday?"</p>

<p>There were certain subjects regarding which,
in spite of their devoted friendship, the
Friendly Terrace quartette could develop considerable
diversity of opinion. But on this occasion,
their unanimity would have gratified
the hospitable instincts of Amy's Aunt Phoebe.
Strawberries boxed and displayed in show
windows, or even transformed into such delicacies
as short cake and ice cream, seemed prosaic
all at once. What they wanted was to be
turned loose in a strawberry patch, to stain
their fingers plucking the strawberries from
the vines. Before leaving the porch the girls
watched Amy pen a note to her relative, accepting
her oft-repeated invitation in behalf
of herself and friends, and suggesting the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Wednesday as a desirable time for their
visit.</p>

<p>A rather cloudy Tuesday awakened anxious
apprehensions in the minds of the four girls,
apprehensions dissipated, however, by the
cloudless dawn of Wednesday. The height of
the strawberry season is the most charming
time of the year. The four ate an early luncheon
at Peggy's home, and then took the trolley
for the outskirts of the city. Once outside
the city, the trolley car bowled along at an exhilarating
pace, and in spite of the prospects
ahead, the girls were almost sorry when the
ten-miles were up, and the breezy ride was
ended.</p>

<p>Aunt Phoebe was a little old lady whose black
skirt was quaintly full and showed signs of
wear, partially concealed by a white ruffled
apron of unusual size. She greeted them as
affectionately as if they had all been nieces by
adoption, and conducted them indoors to take
off their hats. The living room through which
they passed was large and pleasantly and immaculately
neat, the unpainted floor having
been scrubbed to a milky whiteness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The tapping of the girls' heels on the boards
emphasized their bareness. "Got your rugs up
for the summer, I see," remarked Amy casually.
The comment was natural enough under
the circumstances, but unluckily it opened the
door of the closet which contained the Frosts'
family skeleton. Aunt Phoebe reddened as if
Amy's innocent remark had been a slap in the
face. "My sitting room carpet's worn out,"
she said. "It was worn out when I came here.
I patched it and I pieced it and I made it last
a good three years after anybody else would
have put it in the rags, and now he says there's
no sense buying a new one."</p>

<p>"Mr. Frost, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's got awful queer notions, Philander
has. He talks about bare floors being
healthy. Good gracious! It gives me a chill
to think of this room in November without a
carpet on the floor. I've done without lots
of things in my life, but I never was too poor
to have my floors carpeted."</p>

<p>Amy was sorry she had broached the subject,
for now that Aunt Phoebe was started, she
seemed to find it difficult to stop talking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
her grievance. Like many people who do not
ask a great deal of life, she was the more insistent
regarding the few things she counted essential.
The bare floor, echoing noisily under
the tread of her guests, stirred her indignation
and almost spoiled her childlike satisfaction
in entertaining Amy and her friends.</p>

<p>But worse was coming. It appeared that
Aunt Phoebe had a heaped glass dish of berries
to be served in the conventional fashion with
sugar and cream, but she suggested that first
the girls might enjoy helping themselves from
the patch. As this was really what they had
come for, they acquiesced heartily, and Aunt
Phoebe led the way. Her kindly old face lost
its pensiveness as she watched the laughing
girls picking the berries from the vines, their
lips and fingers reddening as the feast proceeded.
Then without any warning, a deep
voice spoke out of the shrubbery, and only too
much to the point. "The commission men,"
said the voice, "are paying twelve cents a box
for them strawberries."</p>

<p>Four berry-pickers straightened themselves
and looked at one another aghast. Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Phoebe rushed furiously to their defense.
"Philander Frost, this is my niece, Amy
Lassell, and she's brought out some young
friends to eat strawberries, because I asked her
to." Her faded blue eyes emitted electric
sparks as she defied him.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, I'm sure," said Mr.
Frost, still with an air of profound melancholy.
"I don't grudge a few strawberries any more
than the next man, but with them bringing
twelve cents a box&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Philander!" The little wrinkled wife was
fairly beside herself with mortification. Her
withered skin, suffused by a burning blush,
rivalled the vivid coloring of youth. "Philander,
I don't care if the strawberries are a
dollar a quart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mr. Frost patiently. "I
just thought I'd mention it." He turned away
while four girls stood motionless in the strawberry
patch, as if there had been a Medusa-like
quality in his gaze, turning them all to stone.</p>

<p>"Go right on, dearies," commanded Aunt
Phoebe, raising her voice defiantly, so that it
should reach the ears of her departing lord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
master. "Eat all you want to." But though
as a matter of principle, the girls attempted to
obey, the sweetness had gone from the luscious
fruit. They ate half-heartedly, ashamed to
meet one another's eyes, calculating, in spite of
themselves, how much Mr. Frost was out of
pocket because of their visit.</p>

<p>Aunt Phoebe was plainly disappointed when
they declared that they had had enough. She
tried to encourage them to think better of it,
and when they still insisted, led the way to the
house. "I don't think much of strawberries
without trimmings, myself," she declared over
her shoulder. "When you taste them with
sugar and cream, I guess you'll find your appetites
coming back."</p>

<p>The porch at the side of the house was shaded
and inviting. Aunt Phoebe insisted on their
seating themselves, while she waited on them.
Against the snowy covering of the small, round
table, the big dish of choice berries made a fine
showing. Then Aunt Phoebe brought out a
pitcher of rich yellow cream, and the spirits
of the crest-fallen group began to revive.
The appearance of a heaping plate-full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cookies was hailed with appreciative smiles.</p>

<p>"Plenty more cookies in the jar," said Aunt
Phoebe, helping them with lavish hand. "And
plenty more berries. Eat all you can."</p>

<p>They had almost reached the point of
forgetting Mr. Frost and his discomforting
comments, when he again made his appearance.
Peggy lost the thread of the story she was
telling and stopped short, but as no one was
listening, that made no difference.</p>

<p>Mr. Frost seated himself and sighed heavily.
"Some folks is afraid to eat too many strawberries,"
he said. "They're likely to cause a
rash."</p>

<p>The girls, not knowing what to say, went on
eating mechanically. Aunt Phoebe, however,
straightened herself over her saucer. "I don't
mind a rash," she announced, "not in such a
good cause."</p>

<p>"It ain't that I care for the expense," Mr.
Frost said feelingly, "though of course, with
the cost of living so high, sensible folks ought
to do without everything that ain't necessary.
Now Phoebe's got an idea that she wants a
new carpet for the sitting room&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got an idea that I'm going to have one,
too," said Aunt Phoebe, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"I tell her that bare floors is all the rage,"
said Mr. Frost, looking from one to another of
the girls, as if he hoped to find an ally in one
of them. "Carpets are hiding-places for all
sorts of germs. The swellest folks there is
have bare floors nowadays, I tell her."</p>

<p>"I guess their bare floors don't look much
like mine," exploded Aunt Phoebe, "just common
pine boards, not even painted."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind letting you paint 'em,"
said Mr. Frost. "Of course paint is very expensive
these days, but if it would make you
feel any better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I want," Aunt Phoebe was beginning
wrathfully, when Amy interrupted. She addressed
herself to Mr. Frost, and her manner
was propitiatory. "A painted floor isn't so
bad," she said. "Lots of folks have painted
floors."</p>

<p>"A body's feet would freeze in winter," exclaimed
Aunt Phoebe, plainly bewildered at
Amy's taking sides against her.</p>

<p>"You want to wear good thick shoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
stockings," replied Mr. Frost, eyeing Amy approvingly.
His manner indicated that as far
as she was concerned, he did not grudge the
strawberries.</p>

<p>"I was going to say," continued Amy, returning
his friendly gaze with interest, "that
I wouldn't mind coming out and painting the
floors for you some day."</p>

<p>The other Friendly Terrace girls looked at
one another in surprise. They could not
understand Amy. Apparently she was trying
to curry favor with Mr. Frost by taking sides
with him against Aunt Phoebe, yet none of
them considered this the real explanation.
Whatever her intention, it was plain that Amy
had made a conquest of Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back.
For the rest of their stay, he
addressed most his remarks to her, and though
his conversation dealt largely with the high cost
of living and the necessity for thrift, their inexplicable
friend seemed highly edified.</p>

<p>When they took their departure, Mr. Frost
again brought up the subject of the floor. "If
you should happen to feel like painting it some
day&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm coming," said Amy smiling up at
him. "I'll get the other girls to help me, and
we'll make short work of it."</p>

<p>"I think I've got pretty near enough paint
left from painting the barn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Phoebe's accession of color suggested
an attack of apoplexy, for the barn was the
color of a ripe pumpkin. Amy hastily interposed,
"Oh, I'll bring the paint."</p>

<p>"Will you now? Well, I call that the right
spirit. I like to see young folks appreciative,"
declared Mr. Frost. "Strawberries are bringing
a good price this year, but I'm sure you're
welcome to every one you et."</p>

<p>On the way to the car Amy walked beside
Aunt Phoebe, holding fast to her arm and chattering
like a magpie. And as she kissed the old
lady good-by, she pulled her close and whispered
in her ear. It was impossible to know
what she said, but Aunt Phoebe's lugubrious
countenance showed an immediate improvement.
She stared at Amy with an expression
of incredulity which presently became a bewildered
smile.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the other Friendly Terrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
girls, as to whether or not Amy had intended
her promise to be taken literally, was
dissipated about a week later when she called
on them to accompany her and assist in the
painting of Aunt Phoebe's sitting-room floor.
Thoughtlessly Amy had selected a date when
Peggy had an imperative engagement. Peggy
urged her to choose another day, but Amy
found insuperable objections to a change.</p>

<p>"But I don't like this," said Peggy. "I ate
as many strawberries as anybody, and if you're
painting the floor to pay your uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back,
I want to do my share."
And to this, Amy replied imperturbably that
she need not worry, for Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back
would be paid in full, without
her assistance.</p>

<p>"It really is a pity Peggy couldn't come."
The trio was fairly on its way. "She knows
more about such work than any of us."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Peggy wouldn't be much of a
help to-day," replied Amy.</p>

<p>"Peggy not a help? Why not?" Priscilla's
manner indicated that if any criticism of
Peggy were implied, she would not stand for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peggy's conscience is such a Johnny-on-the-spot,"
Amy explained. "It never seems
to take a vacation the way ours do, and I'm
afraid it would be dreadfully in the way to-day."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" demanded
Priscilla and Ruth together.</p>

<p>Amy opened the little grip she carried, produced
a small-sized can of paint and handed it
to Priscilla. A similar one was bestowed on
the perplexed Ruth, and then Amy leaned
back and looked from one to the other triumphantly.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do with it?"
frowned Priscilla. Then with a violent start,
"Why, Amy Lassell!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"This paint is moss green."</p>

<p>"And this," cried Ruth excitedly, "is
yellow."</p>

<p>"And in here," explained Amy, patting her
bag tenderly, "are all the colors of the rainbow
in half pint cans. Did you ever see an exhibition
of cubist pictures?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once," replied Priscilla mechanically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
while Ruth too amazed for words, stared
dumbly at her friend.</p>

<p>"Well, that is the way Aunt Phoebe's floor is
going to look when we are through with it."</p>

<p>"Why, Amy," gasped Ruth, suddenly finding
her voice. "You can't do anything like that.
He wouldn't let you."</p>

<p>"He won't be there. I've arranged for
Aunt Phoebe to take him off for the day. The
key to the house has been left hanging on the
back porch."</p>

<p>"Does she know?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't, for I thought it was best for
her to be able to say she didn't know a thing
about it. But she suspects that something's in
the wind."</p>

<p>Priscilla hesitated. "I suppose your idea
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My idea is to make such a looking floor that
he will be only too glad to buy a carpet to cover
it."</p>

<p>The three girls looked at one another, and
then Ruth gave a little nervous giggle. After
a minute Priscilla joined in. And then all
three leaned back in the seats in a paroxysm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
silent laughter, while their fellow passengers
regarded them enviously.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but you're right about
Peggy," admitted Priscilla, at length, wiping
her eyes. "I'm pretty sure she would not have
approved."</p>

<p>"I think it serves him just right," declared
Ruth. "I detest stingy people."</p>

<p>"It does serve him right," said Amy. "He
has plenty of money, but he hates to part with
any of it. Poor Aunt Phoebe has a little
money of her own, and before she married him
she got no end of fun out of doing things for
other people. And now the dear old soul can't
even treat her friends to strawberries without
being humiliated. Anyway," concluded Amy
with decision, "I'm bound she shall have a
carpet for her living room next winter."</p>

<p>They found the farm house on the hill silent
and deserted, the back door locked, and the key
hanging in such plain view that it seemed an
invitation to enter. Indoors they found the
living room made ready against their coming.
All the furniture had been moved into adjoining
rooms and the floor had been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
an extra and quite unnecessary scrubbing.</p>

<p>The girls hastily arrayed themselves for the
work. Priscilla and Amy had brought along
the outfits they had worn as farmerettes, while
Ruth donned a worn-out bathing suit. Then
Amy pried off the covers of her array of cans,
and presented each of her friends with a small
paintbrush. The fun began.</p>

<p>Amy's suggestion that a striking design
should be painted in the middle of the room,
and at each of the four corners, was enthusiastically
accepted, and Priscilla at once undertook
the execution of a Chinese dragon in the
corner of the room which was most in evidence
to one standing in the doorway. Amy taking
possession of the can of yellow paint, set herself
to reproduce a sunrise in the center of the
room, the yellow rays radiating from the
central golden orb in the most realistic manner.
Ruth, her imagination stimulated by the discovery
of a can of black paint, promptly set
about balancing Priscilla's dragon by a black
cat in the opposite corner, its back arched like
a bow, and its tail standing upright like an
ebony plume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They splashed about, admiring one another's
work enthusiastically and complacently accepting
compliments for their own. And when
the various masterpieces had been executed to
the satisfaction of the artists, they fell to work
filling in the remaining spaces with gaily
colored rhomboids, red, yellow, green, black,
and purple. Nothing more gorgeous than
Aunt Phoebe's painted floor could possibly be
imagined. Even the highly colored chromos
on the wall paled before it. In some respects
it suggested an old-fashioned crazy-quilt,
though when the dragon and the black cat were
taken into account, it was more like a bad case
of nightmare. After the girls had finished,
they withdrew to the next room and, gazing
upon it, tried to imagine the sensations of
Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back when its
kaleidoscopic magnificence should break upon
his astonished gaze.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were panic-stricken for fear
the occupants of the farm house should return
before they had taken their departure. They
dressed in such haste that they failed to get the
full benefit of the bottle of turpentine Amy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
brought along for cleansing purposes, and they
went back to town with green and purple
smudges on their fingers. As soon as they
had reached home, they descended on Peggy to
tell her of the manner in which they had fulfilled
Amy's promise, and Peggy listened with
amazement tinged with admiration.</p>

<p>"I'm rather glad you didn't tell me, for I'm
afraid I should have thrown cold water, and I
can't help thinking it's exactly what Uncle
Philander-Behind-His-Back deserves. And if
it really drives him into buying a new carpet,
I shall feel satisfied that you've done the right
thing."</p>

<p>The four girls had agreed to play tennis
Saturday of that week, but early Saturday
morning Amy called Peggy up to ask to be excused.
"Aunt Phoebe is coming in town for
some shopping," she explained, and interrupted
herself by an ecstatic giggle. "And
she wants me to go with her. She wants me to
help her select a carpet for the sitting room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>AN AFTERNOON CALL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla</span> sat at her little dressing table,
studying her reflection in the mirror with an
absorbed intentness which would have impressed
nine observers out of ten as a naïve exhibition
of vanity. This verdict, however,
would have been most unfair. Though many
people considered Priscilla a really handsome
girl, she had always been inclined to be unduly
modest regarding her personal appearance.
Her present scrutiny was solely for the
purpose of discovering the blemish which she
was sure must be apparent to all beholders.</p>

<p>For a girl of her age, Priscilla had thought
very little about the opposite sex. Her devotion
to Peggy had been a sufficient outlet for
her sentiment, while her contempt for those
girls who could think and talk of nothing but
the "boys" had, perhaps, led her to go needlessly
far in the opposite direction. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
youths who had fluttered mothlike about the
tall, graceful girl had met such a baffling indifference
that they had transferred their attentions
to some more responsive luminary,
while Priscilla went on her way unruffled.</p>

<p>But this year things were different. The
four Friendly Terrace chums were no longer
sufficient to themselves. Peggy was engaged.
Since Nelson Hallowell's return from the
service, he had been a very frequent caller at
Ruth's home. And on one or two occasions
when Priscilla had run over to Amy's in the
evening, she had found one of the porch chairs
occupied by Robert Carey. Priscilla began to
have a feeling of being left out, new in her experience
and most unpleasant. She wondered
what there was about her to differentiate her
from other girls. She studied her reflection,
dreading yet half expecting to see some flaw
which would inevitably repel the beholder.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon as Priscilla
faced herself in the glass and tried to discover
the defects that kept admirers at a distance,
affairs had reached a crisis. The University
Field Day had long been a thrilling occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
many of the young people of the city, not
merely because of their interest in the various
events, but because it was customary for each
of the young fellows who attended to ask some
girl to accompany him. Priscilla had taken it
for granted that Peggy would go with Graham,
and was not surprised to learn that Nelson had
been promised the pleasure of Ruth's company
on the important occasion. But when she had
suggested to Amy that they should go together,
and Amy after a moment's hesitation had replied,
"Why, the fact is, Priscilla, Bob Carey
has asked me to go with him," Priscilla was
conscious of a distinct shock. Her subsequent
dejection had nothing to do with the prospect
of missing Field Day. But when she asked
herself if she were really the least attractive
girl in the world, she could see no escape from
an affirmative answer.</p>

<p>It was while she sat there, heavy-hearted and
vaguely resentful, that the maid brought up
a card, one of those small, inobtrusive slips of
cardboard which proclaim the modesty of the
socially inclined male. Priscilla took it, impressed
in spite of herself. Though she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
old enough to have become accustomed to such
little conventions, the life of a college girl is
so necessarily informal that few people who
came to see Priscilla announced their presence
in this fashion. And this was the first time a
young man had sent up his card to Priscilla.</p>

<p>"Mr. Horace Endicott Hitchcock," read
Priscilla, and if the truth be told, she was conscious
of an undefined disappointment. She
had known Horace Hitchcock for a dozen years,
ever since a smug little boy in a velvet suit, he
had attended the children's parties which were
her earliest social dissipations. As he was
about three years older than Priscilla she had
admired him extremely in those days when the
velvet suit was much in evidence. But her
attitude had altered long before she had considered
herself too old to play dolls.</p>

<p>Horace's boyhood had been a trying period.
He had never had a boy friend, the lads of his
own age agreeing with contemptuous unanimity
that he was a "sissy." Perhaps for the
same reason, the girls had found him as little
appealing. But as he neared his majority,
Horace had blossomed into a belated popularity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
He was somewhat effeminate as far as
his appearance went. He talked very rapidly,
and used more gestures than is customary with
young Americans. Horace dressed in excellent
taste, and was somewhat of an authority on
shirts and ties and matters equally important.
Although he was supposed to be an insurance
solicitor, he was never too occupied to attend
any social affair at any hour of the day, and
this gave him an advantage over the young men
who were on duty till five o'clock or later.
Priscilla had seen very little of him since she
had entered college, and now as she looked at
his card she only wondered if he had come to
ask her to play for some entertainment.</p>

<p>Priscilla gave a last dissatisfied glance at her
reflection in the glass, captured a stray lock
with a hairpin, and went downstairs. Sensible
girl as she was, she found herself impressed
by Horace's greeting. He bowed very low
over her hand, like the hero of a picture play,
and drew up a chair for her with great elegance
of manner. To a girl suffering from lack of
proper self-esteem, his air of deference was
peculiarly soothing. Yet even then, it never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
occurred to Priscilla that this was a social call.
She listened to Horace's voluble talk, made
such replies as seemed necessary, noted approvingly
the perfect fit of his light suit, and
the fact that his tie matched his silk socks, and
waited patiently for him to come to the point.</p>

<p>Something like twenty minutes had passed
when Priscilla reached a realizing sense of the
situation. All at once, while Horace was describing
minutely the country house where he
had spent the previous week-end, Priscilla gave
a little start and colored high. It had just
dawned upon her that Horace had not come upon
any utilitarian errand, that he was there for
the sole purpose of seeing her. It took her a
little time to adjust herself to the novel idea,
and if Horace had asked her a point-blank
question during the interval, she would not
have known whether to answer yes or no, for
she had not the least idea what he was talking
about.</p>

<p>Then Priscilla waked up. She exerted herself
to be charming. She talked almost as
fluently as Horace himself. She laughed delightedly
at his little jests; though, if the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
be told, Horace's humor was decidedly anemic.
She listened raptly to his stories of his achievements,
and was ready with the expected
admiring smile when the time arrived. A
curious sense of unreality possessed her. She
felt as if she were taking part in an exciting
game.</p>

<p>"Miss Priscilla," said Horace suddenly,
"are you at all interested in Field Day?"</p>

<p>"It's not so bad when one knows the men,"
Priscilla replied, and the answer showed the
effect of Horace's influence in a little over half
an hour. For Priscilla adored Field Day.
When she watched the various events her heart
pounded as if she herself were taking part in
the hundred yard dash. At the close of an
exciting race, she had often found herself on
her feet, shrieking spasmodically, and waving
her handkerchief, and feeling the smart of
tears in her strained eyes. But instinctively
Priscilla knew that Horace would not consider
Field Day a legitimate cause for excitement,
and so she answered as she did.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I find it a deuce of a bore,"
Horace said. "The crowd and the noise, don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you know. But if you are willing to accompany
me next Friday, Miss Priscilla, I'm
sure this Field Day will prove a delightful exception."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," Priscilla said carelessly.
"I should enjoy going very much." Her nonchalant
acceptance of the invitation gave no
idea of her tumultuous excitement. She was
no longer the odd one of the quartette of
chums. She was no longer left out. Her
misgivings regarding herself were instantaneously
set at rest, for she knew that, had she
been as unattractive as she had feared, Horace
Hitchcock would never have invited her to
accompany him on such an occasion. Her
pulses throbbed, and there was a humming in
her ears as she chattered on without any clear
idea of what she was saying.</p>

<p>Priscilla's feeling of elation had nothing to
do with Horace's personality. Had he been
any other young man, equally well dressed and
well mannered, she would have felt exactly the
same. Yet under the circumstances she experienced
a not unreasonable sense of gratitude.
She shut her eyes to the little affectations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of manner which ordinarily she would
have found amusing. She refused to acknowledge
to herself that Horace was bragging.
She had never liked him, and the Horace who
had invited her to the Field Day exercises was
in all essentials the Horace of the velvet suit;
yet now, if she had heard him criticized, she
would have rushed impetuously to his defense.
In short, Priscilla was started on a course
which many an older and wiser woman has
followed to disaster.</p>

<p>Priscilla was in no hurry to mention the
fact that she expected to be a spectator of the
Field Day events. The very intensity of her
previous qualms made her the more inclined to
treat the present situation nonchalantly. On
Thursday evening, however, she remarked
casually to Peggy that she hoped their seats
would not be too far separated. Peggy looked
up in pleased surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you going, Priscilla? I'm awful glad.
Who's taking you?"</p>

<p>"Horace Hitchcock."</p>

<p>"Horace Hitchcock!" Peggy repeated the
name in such accents of astonishment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Priscilla flushed. "Why not?" she asked
rather coldly.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you saw anything of him."</p>

<p>"I've known him as long as I've known you&mdash;almost
as long as I've known anybody."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Priscilla. I remember
when we used to see him at parties in a
Fauntleroy suit. But I've lost track of him
for an age and I thought you had, too, that's
all." There was an underlying astonishment
in Peggy's apology. She could not understand
Priscilla's seeming readiness to take offense.
And when Priscilla began to talk of something
quite different, Peggy realized with fresh
amazement that the peculiarities of Horace
Hitchcock were, for the present, a tabooed
topic between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>THE RUMMAGE SALE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> vacation! Although the Field Day
exercises, and the few Commencement festivities
to which undergraduates are invited, were
only four days past, classes and lessons seemed
to the Quartet never to have existed; or if so,
only in a dream. And it would be the same
way when college began again in the fall.
Summer, of a few days before, would be a dim
memory of the past.</p>

<p>Though they had not heard from their examinations,
they all felt reasonably confident of
having passed successfully. At any rate, they
had put the thought of them resolutely out of
mind, following Peggy's, "one thing at a time,
and when it's done, it doesn't do any good
worrying about it." Those four days had been
devoted to concentrated doing nothing.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Dulce far Niente</span>' is such a pretty phrase
it makes a virtue of loafing," said Priscilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>And to this, for the time being, the other
three agreed.</p>

<p>It was indirectly through Horace Hitchcock
that the Friendly Terrace girls became
interested in the Rummage Sale. For at the
Field Day exercises Horace and Priscilla had
happened to occupy seats in the Grand Stand
next to Mrs. Sidney Vanderpool, and Horace,
who seemed a prime favorite with that
influential lady, had introduced Priscilla.
Mrs. Vanderpool was in charge of a rummage
sale to be held for the benefit of a local charity,
and recognizing Priscilla's efficiency at a
glance, she had promptly enlisted her under
her banner. Since whatever concerned one of
the Friendly Terrace quartette concerned
all, Mrs. Vanderpool in securing Priscilla's
coöperation had gained four new assistants.</p>

<p>It was Peggy, strange to say, whose
enthusiasm it was hardest to kindle. "Somehow
I never thought much of rummage sales,"
she owned. "Perhaps it is because <i>rummage</i>
always reminds me of <i>rubbish</i>."</p>

<p>"But that's not fair, Peggy," Priscilla remonstrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"Every family has a lot of
things packed away that would be a blessing to
people a little poorer."</p>

<p>Peggy reflected. "I can't think of anything
we could spare that would be much of a blessing
to any one."</p>

<p>"You haven't looked your things over with
that thought in mind. Take Mrs. Vanderpool,
for instance. Why, she'd discard a piece
of furniture we would be proud to put in the
parlor. A chair or sofa we'd think too shabby
to have around would seem magnificent to your
friends, the Bonds."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's something in that,"
owned Peggy.</p>

<p>"Of course there is. Thanks to the rummage
sales, people get rid of a lot of stuff
that's no further good to them; and other
people get a great many things that they can
use, and pay almost nothing for them."</p>

<p>"If they pay so little, why does Mrs. Vanderpool
expect to make such a lot of money!"
demanded Peggy.</p>

<p>"Look at the five-and-ten cent stores. Little
profits count up, if you make sales enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
And in a rummage sale the expenses are so
small that almost everything is profit."</p>

<p>Peggy began to think that her prejudice had
been unreasonable, and she hunted the house
over to find something worth contributing.
But her search was far from satisfactory to
herself. Mrs. Raymond was not one of the
house-keepers who make a practice of hoarding
useless articles. If a piece of furniture broke
down, she had it mended if it were worth repairing;
if not, she either gave it to some
poor family who could make use of it, or else
had it carted away by the rubbish collector.
When Peggy's exhaustive search ended, she
had succeeded in collecting for the sale only a
few pieces of crockery and a carpet-sweeper
which had outlived its halcyon days, though
still capable of picking threads off the carpet.</p>

<p>The sale was to be held in a large vacant
store in the down-town district, and was to
last three days. All contributors had been
asked to send their offerings several days in
advance, and the Friendly Terrace girls, with
a score of others, were on hand to assist in
classifying the articles as they arrived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
were arranging them so as to make the best
possible showing. As Peggy worked with the
others, she was conscious of a return of her
former misgivings. Undoubtedly among the
contributions arriving by the wagon load there
were many articles which would be useful to
some one, but Peggy wondered who would be
able to make use of the cracked pitchers and
leaky kitchen utensils which were coming in
such quantities. She looked disapprovingly at
the loads of worn-out finery, displayed on the
clothing table. In her opinion people who
would buy second-hand evening dresses ought
not to afford any. Of the flimsy evening
frocks, most of them cut excessively low, some
were spotted and soiled, while others were torn
and generally bedraggled. Peggy made up her
mind that under no circumstances would she be
a saleswoman at that table.</p>

<p>The array of bric-a-brac aroused similar
qualms. Looking the collection over, Peggy
wondered at the things people had once regarded
as ornamental. And even though they
now realized their error, and were glad to rid
themselves of these offenses against good taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it seemed to Peggy rather hard that they
should encourage the unenlightened to purchase
such monstrosities under the mistaken
notion that they were beautifying their homes.
She was glad to turn to the book table where,
if nowhere else, really worth-while bargains
were offered. There were piles of the best
magazines, many of them with the leaves uncut.
There were odd volumes of classic
writers, the most of which seemed in excellent
condition. Peggy set herself to make the book
table as inviting as possible, in hopes that the
sales would be gratifying.</p>

<p>But while her original misgivings had returned
in full force, Peggy said nothing about
them. As far as she could see, they were unshared
by any person present. The three girls
who were her most intimate friends were working
away enthusiastically, their bright faces unclouded
by a doubt. Peggy had been a little
startled by the discovery that Amy had deliberately
left her out of the plot for painting
Aunt Phoebe's sitting-room floor. It led her
to wonder if perhaps she was over-particular.</p>

<p>"No one else seems to see anything out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
way," Peggy reflected. "It seems as if it must
be all right, if I'm the only one who thinks it
isn't. Oh, dear, I hope I'm not getting so critical
and fussy that I imagine that things are
wrong when they're not." Again her thoughts
turned to Aunt Phoebe's painted floor. If Amy
had asked her coöperation, she would have refused,
and would have done her best to dissuade
Amy from her reckless scheme. But the
results had been all that could be desired.
Aunt Phoebe had her new carpet, and was radiantly
happy, while Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back
had undoubtedly been taught a lesson
he sorely needed. Strange to say, he did not
seem to hold any grudge against Amy for taking
sides against him. Amy, who had been out
to admire the new carpet, reported that he had
received her without any display of animosity,
and unprotestingly had allowed Aunt Phoebe to
serve her with ice cream. "It must be that
I'm getting too particular," thought Peggy.
"This time I won't say a word."</p>

<p>She broke her resolution, however, when the
committee, who had been delegated to mark the
prices of each article, set to work. Peggy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
comforted herself by recalling Priscilla's
assurance that everything would be sold at
prices almost too small to mention. Instead,
it seemed to the astonished Peggy that a good
price was set on articles which from her standpoint
were quite valueless. "O, don't you
think that is too much?" She could not help exclaiming
as one of the committee attached a
price card to a three legged chair, which kept
an upright position only by balancing itself
against a rickety table.</p>

<p>The lady smiled upon her. "We'll have the
prices rather high the first day," she replied.
"Of course we want to make all we can. Then
we'll reduce them for the second day, and on
the third we'll take anything we can get."</p>

<p>Peggy did not return the smile. She was
perplexed and troubled. She was beginning to
realize that though these women were working
for charity, they knew very little about the
practical problems of the poor. She looked at
the three-legged chair and wondered what she
would do if she saw some reckless mother of a
family preparing to squander real money on
anything so worthless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Peggy had expressed a wish to be
stationed at the book table, Mrs. Vanderpool
had insisted on placing her among the household
furnishings. "You've got such a winning
way, my dear," she said, "and you would
be wasted on the books. Nobody buys books
at a rummage sale except the people who would
buy them anyway. I'm expecting great things
from that persuasive tongue of yours."
Peggy blushed guiltily, even while she smiled.
She was glad Mrs. Vanderpool had such a complimentary
idea of her persuasive powers and
hoped she would not disappoint her.</p>

<p>From the hour of its opening, the rummage
sale was crowded. Peggy's heart went out to
the women who came pouring in as soon as the
doors were opened to the public. Many of
them had a distinctly foreign look. They came
hatless, holding their money tightly, and looking
about them with sharp, dark eyes in search
of the bargains they coveted. In the evening
the shop girls and factory workers were out in
full force, and Peggy noticed uneasily how
inevitably they gravitated toward the cast-off
finery which had aroused her disapproval.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
She turned her back that she might not be a
witness to the thriving business she suspected
that department of doing.</p>

<p>But resolving to allow events to take their
course without a protest, Peggy had failed to
reckon with her inborn inability to shirk responsibility.
The formula which acts as a
sedative to so many consciences, "It's none of
my business," had never proved effective in
her case. And though she stuck to her resolution
on the first day, the developments of the
second proved too much for her. It was late
on that afternoon when she noticed a flutter at
one of the adjacent counters, and discovered
to her astonishment, that the occasion of the
excitement was an acquaintance of her own,
no other than the husband of Elvira Bond.</p>

<p>Peggy had always felt a certain responsibility
for Elvira, due to the fact that she had known
the good-natured, slatternly girl ever since she
could remember. Mrs. Bond had done the
Raymonds' washing, off and on for many years,
less because of her excellence as a laundress,
than because she needed the work. Then
Elvira had grown up, and taken her mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
place at the wash-tubs. The year of America's
entry into the war she had unexpectedly
married a young man considerably above her
in the social scale, who had immediately been
called to the colors.</p>

<p>Elvira's romance had been her awakening.
To Peggy's attentive ear she had confided her
dawning aspirations. "Joe likes things neat
and clean," she explained, a little wistfulness in
her voice. "Not cluttered up the way Ma
keeps 'em. And I'd hate to make him ashamed
of me."</p>

<p>"Of course you would," Peggy had cried.
"And there's not a bit of need, Elvira. Why,
of course you can keep your house as nice as
anybody's. All you've got to do is to make up
your mind that you will."</p>

<p>In the absence of the young husband Peggy
had a watchful eye on Elvira. She had done
her best to keep alive the girl's newly awakened
ambitions, in spite of the discouraging home
atmosphere. And after Joe's return she had
frequently gone to see Elvira in the little home
the young couple had purchased, and were paying
for on the installment plan. In view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
girl's bringing up, it is hardly surprising that
she had her relapses; but on the whole, Peggy
was proud of her. Elvira worked hard, was
developing a commendable thrift, and was extremely
proud of her little home and of her
baby.</p>

<p>It was at one of the bric-a-brac tables that
Peggy discovered Elvira's husband, and he
seemed, as far as she could judge from his
manner and the manner of the women who
were calling his attention to one thing after
another, on the point of investing largely in the
heterogeneous collection. But he happened to
look over his shoulder in Peggy's direction,
recognized her instantly, and came toward her,
his face irradiated by a broad smile.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, Miss Peggy," he exclaimed.
"I'm looking around. I'm thinking of buying
a few little things to take home to the wife."
He slapped his pocket. "It's pay-day, Miss
Peggy, and the best ain't none too good for
Elvira and the kid, I'll swear it ain't."</p>

<p>Peggy looked at him silently. It was the
era of prohibition, yet an unmistakable odor
radiated from Joe's person and confirmed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
suspicion aroused by his unnatural manner.
Peggy's heart sank.</p>

<p>All unconscious of her dismay, Joe was examining
her stock. "What's that, Miss
Peggy?" He indicated by a gesture the
object which had aroused his interest.</p>

<p>"That is a churn, Joe."</p>

<p>"Fine! Fine! I've been wanting a churn
ever since I got married. What's the damage?"</p>

<p>"But you can't want a churn, Joe; you don't
keep a cow."</p>

<p>"No telling, Miss Peggy, I might buy a cow
'most any day." But his vacillating attention
went to a battered table and he gave it a seemingly
close examination. "I'll take it, Miss
Peggy," he declared with a wave of his hand,
"Just the thing for our front room."</p>

<p>"Why, Joe, Elvira has a table for the front
room already."</p>

<p>"Can't have too much of a good thing, you
know," grinned Joe. "Say I like the looks of
that." Peggy's eyes followed his extended
finger and she frowned. "Why, Joe, that's a
coffee urn, and it wouldn't be suitable for a
small family. Besides, it leaks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm bound to take home something, Miss
Peggy," snickered Joe. "Nothing small about
me. My pockets are pretty well lined, and
you'll find me a good customer."</p>

<p>"Joe," said Peggy desperately, "Listen to
me. You don't want any of this stuff in your
pretty little home. It's not good enough."</p>

<p>"I guess I know what I want."</p>

<p>"No, Joe. You must excuse me, but to-day
you don't know what you want. If you were
quite yourself you'd never think of taking
Elvira home a rickety table or a churn."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that I'm drunk."
Joe's manner had lost its suavity. His eyes
flashed as he regarded her.</p>

<p>"No, Joe, you're not drunk, but you've been
drinking and you're not yourself. And I
know by to-morrow you'll feel awfully sorry if
you have carried a lot of rubbish into your dear
little home."</p>

<p>For a moment Joe wavered between amiability
and anger. His masculine pride was
touched by the implication that he did not know
his own mind, and alcohol had quickened his
propensity to take offense. But on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hand, there was something disarming in the
way Peggy spoke of his wife and his home, and
her smile was appealing. Mrs. Vanderpool
had counted on her winning way and it was as
effective as she had hoped, though Peggy did
not apply it exactly as she had expected of her.</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, Joe capitulated.
"I guess you're right, Miss Peggy. When a
fellow's had a few drinks, most anything looks
like a bargain. Guess this is a lot of junk."</p>

<p>"There's nothing here that you and Elvira
want, I'm sure of that, Joe."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Peggy."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Joe. Tell Elvira I'll be over to
see her very soon."</p>

<p>Peggy drew a breath of relief when she saw
Joe leave the building. But her congratulatory
mood was not to last. For not long
after Joe's departure, she became aware of
Mrs. Vanderpool at her elbow.</p>

<p>"Well, you had a profitable customer at
last," smiled the lady. "Wanted to buy you
out, didn't he?"</p>

<p>The possibility of evasion did not occur to
Peggy. She lifted her frank eyes. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
talked about buying a lot of useless things,"
she answered, "but of course I wouldn't let him.
You see, he'd been drinking and he didn't
really know what he wanted. And besides, I
know his wife."</p>

<p>The blank expression with which Mrs. Vanderpool
regarded her made plain the impossibility
of their ever coming to an understanding.
Peggy started to go on, and then lapsed
into silence, realizing the uselessness of further
explanations. Mrs. Vanderpool having relieved
her mind by a long stare, turned
majestically away, and Peggy heard her a little
later, talking animatedly of some one who, it
appeared, was totally lacking in the business instinct.
Peggy thought she could come very
near guessing the identity of the person referred
to. But as she went on pointing out to
possible purchasers the flaws in her wares, she
made up her mind that the chance of being
over-particular in matters of right and wrong
was very trifling compared with the danger of
not being particular enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>PRISCILLA HAS A SECRET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peggy</span> was worried about Priscilla. For the
first time in their years of intimacy she could
not understand her friend; and worst of all, it
seemed out of the question to discuss the situation
and come to an understanding.</p>

<p>"Do you think she can like him?" Peggy
asked the other Friendly Terrace girls despairingly.
"Because he's always seemed to
me almost a joke. I don't know how I could
bear to have Priscilla fall in love with a man I
wanted to laugh at."</p>

<p>Though both girls would have been glad to
reassure her, an ominous silence followed her
outbreak. "There's no accounting for tastes,"
said Ruth at length, a suggestion of superiority
in her tone.</p>

<p>"Priscilla ought to have a good talking
to," exclaimed Amy. "She's got plenty of
sense, and to think of her letting Horace Hitchcock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hang around! I'd like to tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't, Amy," Peggy interrupted.
"It would never do to let her know how you
feel about it. That's one of the things that
make me so anxious&mdash;she's so awfully touchy
on the subject of Horace. She won't have him
criticized."</p>

<p>Peggy had valiantly done her best to cultivate
a liking for Horace Hitchcock. Since the
fatal Field Day when he had acted as Priscilla's
escort, his attentions had been unremitting.
He had called several times a week. He had
brought Priscilla flowers and boxes of candy, to
say nothing of books of poems, from which he
had read aloud to her by the hour. Peggy,
assuming that since Priscilla was seeing so
much of Horace, he must be quite a different
person from what she supposed, had invited
him to her home along with the others of her
little circle, only to find it would not do.
Horace and the others would not mix any more
than oil and water.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't ask that Hitchcock
here again," Graham implored Peggy,
after an evening that had been a failure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
socially considered. "He puts on airs as if
he were the Prince of Wales&mdash;no, that's not
fair to the prince. But Hitchcock is a snob and
a sissy and he makes me tired."</p>

<p>"But if Priscilla likes him, Graham&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She can't," Graham had argued, not unreasonably.
"She must see through him just
as the rest of us do; and even while she's so
pleasant to him, she must be laughing in her
sleeve."</p>

<p>But reasonable as Graham's stand had
seemed, Priscilla was in no mood to laugh at
Horace Hitchcock. Indeed, she was deliberately
shutting her eyes to his weaknesses, and
holding before herself such an idealized likeness
of the real Horace that no one but herself
would have recognized it. Horace's attentions
flattered her vanity. Every call helped to reassure
her anxiety in the matter of her own
attractiveness. Moreover, Priscilla was a
little dazzled by Horace's seeming familiarity
with the people whose names were chronicled
in the society columns of the daily paper. She
had seen for herself that Mrs. Sidney Vanderpool
regarded him with favor, and Horace had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
been at some pains to let her know that other
ladies, some of them young and beautiful, held
him in equally high esteem. That he should
leave girls, who could not go to New York for a
week without the fact brought to the public attention
in the daily papers, in order that he
might spend his evenings with her, gave
Priscilla an intoxicating sense of power.</p>

<p>But foolish as this all was, worse was to
come, and all because Amy disregarded Peggy's
prudent counsel. Peggy had discovered an
undue sensitiveness in Priscilla, where Horace
was concerned, and had been sensible enough
to perceive that any criticism of her ardent
admirer, instead of prejudicing Priscilla
against him, was likely to have the opposite
effect. It hardly need be said that Amy did not
flout Peggy's advice, but in the course of a conversation
with Priscilla she lost her temper
and subsequently her head.</p>

<p>It began with a most amiable intention on
Amy's part. "Is Horace coming up to-night?"
she asked Priscilla, as the two strolled along
the Terrace in the hazy hush of a summer afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I shouldn't be surprised to see him,"
owned Priscilla, with a becoming blush.</p>

<p>"Bob telephoned me this morning that he'd
be up. If Horace comes, bring him over and
I'll try to get Peggy and Ruth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall you ask Nelson Hallowell?" Priscilla
inquired, a reservation in her tone which Amy
did not understand.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Ruth to bring him if he comes, and
he's pretty sure to be on hand," laughed Amy.
"He's making up for the chances he missed
when he was in the service."</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid we can't come," said
Priscilla. "Horace thinks Bob Carey is fine,
and he rather likes Graham, but he draws the
line at Nelson."</p>

<p>Amy stopped short, her plump face crimson.
"Please tell me what you mean by his drawing
the line?"</p>

<p>"Well, Amy, I've no doubt that Nelson is a
very fine fellow, as far as morals go, but his
social position, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about it?" As the two girls were
standing side by side, it was quite unnecessary
for Amy to speak so loudly. Her defiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tone seemed to challenge the entire block.</p>

<p>"Hush, Amy. I'm not deaf. Of course
Nelson comes from quite an ordinary family,
and he's only a clerk, and Horace really doesn't
care to meet him socially."</p>

<p>Amy burst into an angry laugh. "Horace
Hitchcock said that. What a joke!"</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you, Amy."
Priscilla spoke with extreme frigidity.</p>

<p>"Why, there's enough in Nelson Hallowell's
little finger to make several Horaces. To think
of that dandified little manikin's turning up his
nose at a fellow like Nelson."</p>

<p>"Amy Lassell, how dare you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fudge, Priscilla, you know perfectly
well what Horace Hitchcock is, and you needn't
pretend to admire him, for I know better."</p>

<p>"I won't listen to you any longer," cried
Priscilla furiously, "slandering my friends."
She turned abruptly and crossed the street.
The two girls continued on their homeward
way with the width of the Terrace between
them, each looking steadily ahead, ignoring the
other's presence.</p>

<p>Before Amy reached home she was sorry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
She saw she had been wrong as well as right.
Her whole-hearted championship of Nelson had
not necessitated sneering at Horace. Amy
realized that Priscilla had good reason to be
angry, and resolved on a whole-hearted apology
next day.</p>

<p>It was a pity she had not followed up her
feeling of penitence by immediate action, for
when Horace came that evening he found
Priscilla in an unwonted mood. She had
dramatized the whole affair to herself. Everyone
was unjust to Horace. Even Peggy
allowed her childish prejudices to influence her
unwarrantedly. But she herself was Horace's
friend and she would be loyal to that friendship,
cost what it might.</p>

<p>A few minutes after his arrival Horace
suggested a walk in the neighboring park,
which had been so little "improved" that
walking through it was almost like strolling
along country lanes. Though the night
was warm, most of the populace preferred the
movies, and Horace and Priscilla had the
park practically to themselves. The night
wind sighed languorously through the trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
The air was full of ineffable fragrances.</p>

<p>"Oh, Priscilla," exclaimed Horace suddenly,
and caught her hand. It seemed to Priscilla
that her heart stood still. There was a note in
Horace's voice she had never heard before.
She was sure that something wonderful was
happening. And the irritating part was that
she could not do justice to it, for she kept
thinking of something else. She should, she
was sure, be entirely absorbed in what Horace
was going to say; and right at that moment, she
wondered if Ruth and Nelson were sitting on
Amy's porch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Priscilla," Horace was murmuring,
"Do you not feel as I do, that we have met and
loved before? You were mine, Priscilla, when
the pyramids were building. You were mine
in Babylon. Tell me that you have not
forgotten. Tell me that you love me."</p>

<p>It was only about half an hour from that
impassioned speech before they were walking
home decorously along the lighted streets, but
Priscilla had a feeling as if she had been away
for months and months. An unbelievable thing
had happened. She was engaged. It was understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that the engagement was not to be
mentioned at present, not even to Priscilla's
father and mother. Horace had said something
to the effect that to let outsiders into
their secret would bruise the petals of the
flower of love, and she had agreed to the postponement
of that catastrophe, without asking
herself why the flower of love should be so
fragile. But the fact remained that she was
the second of the quartette to become engaged,
and she took a rather foolish satisfaction in
the realization. She made up her mind that
her former qualms as to her own unattractiveness
were without foundation, for otherwise
a social favorite like Horace would never have
asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>Priscilla's father and mother were on the
porch when the young people reached home,
and, as it was much too warm to stay indoors,
the evening which had contained so thrilling
an episode ended rather tamely. Mr. Combs
and Horace exchanged ideas on local politics,
and Mrs. Combs and Horace expressed themselves
on the subject of the weather. Priscilla
had nothing to say on either interesting topic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
She was trying to realize that some day, instead
of saying "Mr. Combs" and "Mrs.
Combs," Horace would be addressing her
parents as "father" and "mother." This
seemed so extraordinary that she was almost
inclined to believe that she had dreamed the
whole thing, though the significantly tender
pressure of Horace's fingers, as he said good-night,
assured her to the contrary.</p>

<p>Priscilla slept very poorly that night. Her
dreams were troubled. And each time she
woke, which was on the average of once an
hour, she had a dreadful sense of impending
disaster. On each occasion it took her several
minutes to convince herself that nothing was
wrong, that instead she was a very fortunate
and happy girl, singled out of the world of
girls by a most unusual young man. And thus
reassured, she would drop off to sleep, to start
again with troubled dreams, and to go again
through the whole program.</p>

<p>Owing to her restless night, Priscilla overslept
and had to dress in a hurry to avoid being
late to breakfast. By expedition she reached
the dining room just after her mother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
seated herself. Her father followed a half
minute later, and leaning over her mother's
chair kissed her cheek. "Know what day it
is?"</p>

<p>"Of course, silly," laughed Mrs. Combs.
"But I'm astonished to hear that you do."</p>

<p>Smiling broadly, Mr. Combs went around the
table and took his seat. "We should have
planned a celebration," he remarked.</p>

<p>"What, and advertise our advanced age!"
exclaimed his wife in mock consternation.</p>

<p>"That's so," owned Mr. Combs with a
chuckle. "I remember when a silver wedding
seemed to me significant of extreme age. What
do you think, daughter, of having parents old
enough to have been married twenty-five
years?"</p>

<p>Then Priscilla knew what was the matter with
her. She thought of sitting opposite Horace
Hitchcock twice a day, year in and year out, for
a quarter of a century, and her heart turned
sick within her. All at once she knew how
his affections of manner would grate on one
who watched them for twenty-five years. He
had a way of raising his eye-brows and pursing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his mouth which, she was convinced, would
drive her frantic in course of time. And then
her relentless common-sense, awake at last,
went on to assure her that the Horace Hitchcock
who had made love to her in the park the
previous evening was in all essentials the smug,
vain little boy nobody liked. She watched her
father and mother exchanging smiles and knew
that such good comradeship between Horace
and herself was unthinkable. She doubted if
there would be a smile left in her after twenty-five
years of his society.</p>

<p>"You look tired this morning, Priscilla,"
said Mr. Combs. "And I can't say I wonder.
That admirer of yours makes me rather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a very pleasant boy, I'm sure," interrupted
Mrs. Combs hastily, "though I wish
his manners were just a little simpler. But
he always looks so neat that it's refreshing to
the eye. And by the way, dear, I think you
had better see your tailor and get samples for
your fall suit. You've got to the point where
you must have something."</p>

<p>Priscilla did not notice her mother's dextrous
changing of the subject. She was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
absorbed in looking ahead twenty-five weary
years. Of course, in view of her discovery, the
only sensible thing to do was to get in touch
with Horace, and tell him that the lady with
whom he had been on such friendly terms in
Babylon was an entirely different person. But
that sane and simple way of escape never occurred
to Priscilla. She had given her word.
She must stand by it, no matter what it cost.</p>

<p>Amy came over about eleven o'clock, looking
very penitent. "Priscilla," she said, "I don't
blame you a bit for getting angry yesterday.
I'm ashamed of what I said. Of course," added
Amy, her natural candor getting the better of
her, "Horace Hitchcock doesn't appeal to me,
but that doesn't excuse me for calling him a
manikin, and you have a right to choose your
friends to please yourself."</p>

<p>Priscilla's acceptance of this apology took
Amy by surprise. She dropped her head on
her visitor's shoulder&mdash;as Priscilla was tall
and Amy was short, this was a feat requiring
considerable dexterity&mdash;and burst into tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>THE FRIENDLY TERRACE ORPHANAGE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla's</span> engagement, instead of interrupting
her intimacy with her chums on Friendly
Terrace, seemed to intensify it. Up to the
night that she had walked with Horace in the
park, and he had claimed her on the score of
an affection dating back to Babylon, Priscilla
had rather enjoyed informing Peggy and others
that she would be unable to join in their plans
for the evening, as she was expecting a caller.
But now all this was changed. Instead, when
Horace called up to suggest coming out, he was
very likely to hear that his sweetheart of Babylonian
days had an imperative engagement
with Peggy, or Ruth, or Amy, or more probably
with all three.</p>

<p>It was after an evening spent at a moving
picture house that Peggy made a suggestion
destined to have more momentous results than
she dreamed. They had gone early to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the crowd which a popular film is likely to
draw even in the warmest weather, and at nine
o'clock they were occupying chairs on Peggy's
porch, and discussing the heat. "How about
ice cream?" inquired Amy, fanning herself
with a magazine some one had left in the hammock.</p>

<p>Before any one could answer, Peggy had interposed
with her astonishing suggestion.
"Girls, I move we adopt a French orphan."</p>

<p>Amy forgot her interest in ice cream. "A
French orphan," she gasped, "What for?"</p>

<p>"Well, there are plenty of reasons from the
orphan's standpoint, and several from ours, it
seems to me. Do you know we're getting extravagant."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy," Ruth reproached her. "Why,
as far as clothes go, I never got along with so
few in my life."</p>

<p>"I didn't say we were extravagant in clothes.
But do you know, we're getting to spend lots
of money for little, no-account things. How
many nights this week have we been to a
movie?"</p>

<p>The question was a rhetorical one, as Peggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
knew the answer as well as any one. But
nevertheless Amy replied, "We've been three
times, but one night the boys took us."</p>

<p>"It costs just as much, no matter who pays.
There are four of us; and at twenty-five cents
apiece, that makes a dollar an evening. Three
dollars a week for movies, just for us four."</p>

<p>"Goodness," exclaimed Amy in as astonished
a tone as if this very simple arithmetical calculation
had been beyond her. "That does
seem a lot."</p>

<p>"And that's not all," continued Peggy.
"We've had ice cream, or ice cream soda, or
something of the sort, at least three times
this week, and these days you can't go near a
soda fountain for less than fifteen cents, and
you're more likely to pay twenty or twenty-five.
If we call our bill two dollars, that's putting it
pretty low. Five dollars, altogether."</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> too much, Peggy," Priscilla agreed.
"Unless you stop to count up, you wouldn't
believe how much you can spend and all the
time think you've been economical. But why
the French orphan?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's awfully hard work saving by main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
strength, and it's easy enough if you have
something to save for. If I happen to feel
hungry for ice cream&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amy groaned. "Don't!" she said in a hollow
voice. "If we're not going to have any,
for pity's sake don't talk about it."</p>

<p>Peggy heartlessly ignored her friend's protest.
"If I'm hungry for ice cream, it doesn't
do me much good to tell myself that I had a
dish night before last. I'll just think, 'Oh,
well, what's twenty-five cents!' But if I'm
saving up for something, it's a different matter.
We found that out when we were paying for
our Liberty Bonds."</p>

<p>"Won't it cost a great deal to adopt an
orphan?" asked Ruth doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Why, we won't have to pay all its expenses.
But there are lots of French children left without
fathers and mothers, who have some relative
who can give them a home if they have
a little extra to help them out. I think forty
dollars will do it."</p>

<p>"Forty dollars a year?" Amy exclaimed in
amazement.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure that's it. Mrs. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was talking to me about it just the other day,
and I'm certain she said forty dollars."</p>

<p>"Then let's adopt an orphan right away,"
cried Amy. "And we'll have money enough
left for sodas."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I didn't mean we should
give up all our good times," Peggy exclaimed.
"Only it seemed to me we were getting a little
too extravagant. Then if you all agree, I think
I'll go and telephone Mrs. Alexander that we'll
take an orphan. She's worried because people
aren't as interested as they ought to be."</p>

<p>It was while Peggy was at the telephone that
a small girl appeared, carrying a large bundle.
"I've brought home Mrs. Raymond's dress,"
she said shyly, looking from one to another of
the occupants of the porch.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Raymond isn't home, but Miss Peggy
is. She's telephoning now, but she'll be out
in a minute," said Priscilla.</p>

<p>"You'd better sit down and rest while you
wait for her," suggested Ruth kindly, pushing
forward a porch rocking-chair. The small girl
accepted the invitation and looked smaller than
ever in the capacious depths of the big chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy came out beaming. "Mrs. Alexander
is perfectly delighted, girls. She says&mdash;Why,
hello, Myrtle!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Miss Peggy," returned the girl with
the bundle. "I brought home your mother's
dress. Aunt Georgie couldn't get it finished
any earlier."</p>

<p>"Mother gave you up for to-night, Myrtle.
She left at eight o'clock, but I think I know
where she put the money."</p>

<p>Peggy's conjecture proved correct. She
brought out the amount of the dressmaker's
bill, and having counted it before Myrtle's eyes,
she folded the bills carefully and stuffed them
into Myrtle's diminutive pocket book. "Shall
you be glad when school opens, Myrtle?" she
asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to school any more, Miss
Peggy."</p>

<p>"What! You're going to leave school?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Georgie can't afford to keep me any
longer. Everything is so high," sighed the
child, with a worldly-wise air that would have
seemed funny had it not been so apparent that
she knew what she was talking about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you can't be nearly fourteen, Myrtle,"
protested Peggy. "And you were doing so
well in school."</p>

<p>"I'm twelve in September, but Aunt Georgie
can get permit for me to work, if she can't
afford to keep me in school."</p>

<p>"Would you rather work than go to school?"
asked Amy, rather tactlessly.</p>

<p>The eyes of the little girl filled. She sniffed
bravely as she fumbled for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I like school better," she explained, a catch
in her voice. "But I don't like to be a burden."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence on the porch as
the little figure went down the walk, and then
Priscilla murmured pityingly, "Poor child!"</p>

<p>"It's a shame," exclaimed Peggy warmly.
"She's a bright little thing. She's not twelve
till September, and she's ready for the high
school already. If she could go to school four
years more she'd probably be able to earn a
good living, but she'll never do very well if she
stops school now, for she's not strong enough
for heavy work."</p>

<p>"It almost seems a pity," Ruth suggested,
"that we've just adopted a French orphan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
It seems there are orphans right at home who
need help just as much."</p>

<p>Peggy sighed. "I'm not sorry about the
French orphan. I suppose we can't imagine
the need over there. But I do wish we could
do something for Myrtle."</p>

<p>"Peggy Raymond," warned Amy. "Don't
let your philanthropy run away with you, and
get the idea that we're an orphan asylum. One
orphan is all we can manage."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Peggy agreed hastily.
"Only I was wondering&mdash;poor little Myrtle!"</p>

<p>"Can't her aunt afford to give her an
education?" Priscilla asked, "Or is she
stingy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose it's pretty hard for Miss
Burns to get along with everything so expensive.
She's not a high-priced dress-maker, and
besides she's mortally slow; one of the puttering
sort, you know. At the same time," added
Peggy, "I mean to see her and have a talk
with her about Myrtle."</p>

<p>Peggy was as good as her word. As postponement
was never one of her weaknesses,
she saw Miss Burns the following day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the faded little spinster shed tears as she discussed
Myrtle's future.</p>

<p>"Of course I know she ought to go on
through high school," she sobbed. "She's been
at the head of her class right up through the
grades, and if she could finish high school, she
wouldn't need to ask any odds of anybody.
But I've laid awake night after night thinking,
and I can't see my way to do it."</p>

<p>"If you had a little help, Miss Burns, I suppose
you could manage, couldn't you? What
is the very least you could get along on and
let Myrtle stay in school?"</p>

<p>"Why she can't earn a great deal of course,"
said Miss Burns, wiping her eyes. "She's
not old enough for a sales-woman, and she's
not strong enough for any hard work, and she
don't know anything about stenography."</p>

<p>"And what is the very least you think you
could take in place of having Myrtle go to
work?"</p>

<p>Miss Burns was one of the people who have
a constitutional aversion to answering a direct
question, but Peggy's persistence left her no
loop-hole of escape. Cornered at last, she expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the opinion that she could do with a
hundred dollars. For some reason not quite
clear in her own mind, Peggy had hoped it
might be less, and her face showed her disappointment.
"You think that is the very least
you could get along on, Miss Burns."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is, Miss Peggy. Maybe I
should have said a hundred and fifty. Look
at the price of coal."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," Peggy agreed. "Well, perhaps
something will come up so Myrtle won't
have to leave school. I'm sure I hope so."</p>

<p>Peggy repeated the substance of her conversation
with Miss Burns to her three chums that
afternoon as they were on the way out to Amy's
Aunt Phoebe's. For in their efforts to circumvent
the high cost of living, the Friendly Terrace
girls had begun making weekly or even
semi-weekly visits to the country. The season
had been a favorable one for all garden produce,
but Mr. Frost was finding it difficult to
get anything like the help he needed. The
girls went out into the garden, picked and
pulled what they wanted, paid a price which,
compared with the charges in the retail markets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
seemed extremely reasonable, and came
home with loaded market baskets and a tinge
of sunburn in their cheeks. The weekly saving
paid their car-fare many times over, and
the fact that they all were together lent a
festive air to the enterprise.</p>

<p>Peggy's three friends listened silently to
their story of her visit to Miss Burns. Peggy's
generosity was always leading her to attempt
things far too big for her. The girls had stood
by her loyally in the matter of the French
orphan, but there they drew the line. A second
orphan was too much.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Amy said, with an air of dismissing
the subject. "But I don't see that
we can do anything for her."</p>

<p>"You don't think, do you," Peggy hesitated,
"that we could give a little entertainment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy, people are bored to death with
benefits and drives, and to try to raise money
for a little girl nobody knows about would be
hopeless, especially when she's no worse off
than thousands of others."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's so," Peggy replied, and
reluctantly dropped the subject. Under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
submission was a persistent hope that something
might happen to aid her in the matter
she had so much at heart. But the last thing
she or any one else would have thought was
that such assistance would come from Uncle
Philander-Behind-His-Back.</p>

<p>Mr. Frost had been having an unusually hard
time with help and was in an exceptionally bad
humor. He was one of the men who, when out
of sorts, invariable relieve their minds by criticism
of the opposite sex. He had heard the
girls chattering as they picked the lima beans,
and doubtless that furnished the text for his
ill-natured sermon.</p>

<p>"Women's tongues do beat all," he declared,
as the girls came to the house to pay their
reckoning. "It's small wonder they don't
count much when it comes to work. They get
themselves all wore out talking."</p>

<p>"I think we do some other things beside
talking," declared Peggy, dimpling in a disarming
fashion.</p>

<p>"And I can't see that we say any sillier
things than men do," added Amy.</p>

<p>"O, men can talk or be quiet, just as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
please, but a woman's got to talk or die. You
couldn't pay her enough to get her to hold her
tongue."</p>

<p>"You could pay me enough," said Peggy
with spirit.</p>

<p>"Me, too," Amy cried.</p>

<p>Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back sneered
contemptuously. "Why, I'd give you four a
hundred dollars to hold your tongues for a
week."</p>

<p>"Girls," cried Peggy turning to her friends,
"I move we take him up on that."</p>

<p>Had Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back been
less disagreeable, less contemptuous, the girls
might have hesitated, for a week of silence is
an ordeal to the least voluble. But Mr. Frost's
sneers, combined with Peggy's enthusiasm,
swept them off their feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll take you up," Amy cried, and
Priscilla and Ruth nodded approval.</p>

<p>Uncle Philander was a little taken aback, and
showed it. "You understand when I said hold
your tongues, I meant it. If there's an <i>aye</i>,
<i>yes</i>, or <i>no</i> out of any of the four of you, it's
all off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," agreed the four girls in chorus.</p>

<p>Mr. Frost was plainly growing nervous. "Of
course I haven't any way to keep tab on you."</p>

<p>"Philander," cried his wife, bristling with
indignation, "If you think Amy or any of her
friends would lie for the sake of money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't mean that," he half apologized.
"I put all four of you on your honor. Not a
word out of you, not so much as an <i>ouch</i>."</p>

<p>"But we can write notes and explain to our
families, of course," cried Peggy.</p>

<p>"Of course," cried Amy, as Mr. Frost hesitated.
"And talk on our fingers. All you said
was <i>tongues</i>."</p>

<p>"You can write all the notes you want to,"
conceded Uncle Philander generously. Now
that he had time to think of it, he was convinced
that the conditions he had imposed
could not possibly be complied with. Who had
ever heard of four lively girls maintaining an
unbroken silence for a week? His hundred
dollars was safe.</p>

<p>After some discussion it was decided that
the week should begin the following morning,
to give the girls ample chance to explain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
singular undertaking to their friends. And
then the four started off with their heavy baskets,
chattering excitedly, as if in the hopes of
saying in the few hours remaining before bed
time, all they would ordinarily have said in the
next seven days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>THE LONGEST WEEK ON RECORD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a Thursday when the four Friendly
Terrace girls entered on their remarkable contract
with Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back,
and Friday began the longest week recorded in
the experiences of any of the four. According
to the calendar, it contained only the usual
seven days. According to the clock, each of
these days consisted of the customary twenty-four
hours. But the four chums knew
better. It was at least a month long. They
had spent Thursday evening explaining the
situation to their friends and relatives and saying
good-by as if for a week's absence. It was
not to be expected that their news would meet
the same reception in all quarters. Fathers and
mothers, while not exactly approving, were on
the whole rather amused, and inclined to take
the attitude that girls will be girls. Among
their friends outside, their announcement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
received with a surprise that was sometimes
suggestive of enjoyment, and again of indignation.</p>

<p>Peggy found Graham particularly obdurate.
"Not to speak to me for a week? Well, I like
that!"</p>

<p>"I can write you letters, dear."</p>

<p>"Letters!" Graham's repetition of the word
was anything but flattering to Peggy's epistolary
efforts. "Of course," he went on in a
milder tone, "I love your letters when I'm
away from you. But to read letters instead
of talking to you is like&mdash;like eating dried
apple pie in October."</p>

<p>"It's only a week," said Peggy, but she
sighed. And her sigh would have been much
more vehement had she dreamed how long that
week would prove.</p>

<p>Priscilla writing a little note to Horace
Hitchcock did not sigh over the prospect that
she could exchange no words with him for seven
days. Indeed she was conscious of a profound
relief. Recently Horace had taken up the philosophical
style in conversation, and Priscilla,
as she listened, frequently found herself unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to understand a word he was saying. At first
she assumed that this was due to her not having
given him sufficiently close attention, and
she had chided herself for her wandering
thoughts. But things were no better when she
listened her hardest. Priscilla knew that she
was not a fool. She had finished her junior
year in college, and her class standing in all
philosophical subjects had been excellent. If
she could not understand what Horace was
talking about, she felt reasonably sure that the
explanation was not in her own intellectual
lack but because Horace was talking nonsense.
The polysyllables he used so glibly and the
epigrammatic phrases which to the unthinking
might have seemed indicative of erudition and
originality, when Priscilla came to analyze
them seemed to have no more relation to one
another than glittering beads strung on a wire.
Priscilla was driven to the conclusion that
Horace had been reading literature considerably
over his head, and that he was reproducing
for her benefit a sort of <i>pot-pourri</i> of recollections,
blended without much regard to their
original connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>But this was not the only reason why Priscilla
had a sense of relief in writing to ask
Horace not to call for a week. As the days
went on, the thought of her silver wedding had
been increasingly painful. Horace's affectations,
to which for a time she had deliberately
closed her eyes, were continually more glaringly
in evidence. Once, when they were alone, Priscilla
had tremulously hinted that perhaps they
had been mistaken in supposing themselves
fitted for each other, and Horace's reception
of the suggestion had terrified her unutterably.
He had addressed himself to the stars and
asked if it were true that there was neither
faith nor constancy in womankind. Then he
had looked at Priscilla, with an expression of
agony, and said, "I thought it was you who was
to heal my tortured heart, and now you have
failed me." But when he began to put his
hand to his forehead and mutter that life was
only a series of disappointments and that the
sooner it was over the better, Priscilla, white
to the lips, had assured him that he had misunderstood
her. Her efforts to restore his
serenity were not altogether successful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
she did not feel at ease about him until, a day
or two later, she saw his name among the guests
at a dinner dance, at Mrs. Sidney Vanderpool's
country house. But the interview had confirmed
her certainty that there was no escaping
the snare into which she had walked with eyes
wide open. And for that reason a week free
from Horace's society was more than welcome.</p>

<p>The silent week starting Friday morning had
seemed rather a joke to begin with. At four
breakfast tables, four girls who contributed not
a syllable to the conversation, contributed
largely, nevertheless, to the family gaiety.
But by noon the humorous phase of the situation
had passed, at least for the four chiefly
concerned. All of them went about with an
expression of Spartan-like resolve, blended
with not a little anxiety. For when people
have been chattering animatedly every day for
fifteen or twenty years, it is very easy for an
exclamation to escape their lips in spite of
resolutions to the contrary.</p>

<p>Peggy probably had the hardest time of any
one. For her brother, Dick, although fond of
calling attention to a fuzzy excrescence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he denominated his mustache, was as fond of
mischief as he had ever been. And while undoubtedly
he would have been sorry to have
Peggy break her vow of silence, and lose the
hundred dollars which meant another year in
school for little Myrtle Burns, he nevertheless
subjected his sister to any number of nerve-racking
tests. A crash as of a falling body
in an upstairs room, a cry of anguish from the
cellar, a loud knocking on the ceiling of her
room apparently by ghostly fingers, were among
the devices Dick used for the testing of his
sister. On each occasion Peggy started convulsively,
but somehow or other choked back
the cry that rose to her lips, "Oh, what is it?
What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Though Dick was the only one of the Raymond
family who made deliberate attempts to
betray his sister into unguarded speech, Mrs.
Raymond, innocent as were her intentions, was
almost as much of a stumbling-block. "Now
what do you think, Peggy," she would begin,
"had we better try Turners again or&mdash;" And
then catching sight of the Joan-of-Arc expression
on Peggy's face, she would break off her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
question in the middle, and cry, "Oh, dear, I
entirely forgot! I shall certainly be glad when
this ridiculous week is over."</p>

<p>There was one advantage in a week of silence.
The girls were allowed to write letters, and they
took full advantage of that permission. They
wrote to aunts and uncles and cousins and all
sorts of neglected relatives. They wrote to
old friends, who had moved to other cities.
They wrote to the girls they had come to know
in their work as farmerettes. They wrote&mdash;all
four of them&mdash;to Lucy Haines, a country
girl they had helped one summer vacation, now
a successful teacher. If all weeks had been
like this one, the postman who collected the
mail from the Friendly Terrace letter-box
would have needed an assistant. Peggy also
wrote to Graham every day, and she tried to
make her letters as sprightly and entertaining
as possible, so that he should not miss their
daily talks so much. But under the circumstances
there was not a great deal to tell, and
if it had not been for Dick's machinations, which
Peggy repeated in much detail, she feared that
her missives would have proved dull reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Every afternoon the four girls met at the
home of one or the other of the quartette,
bringing sewing or fancy work. They usually
sat indoors, for if a neighbor conversationally
inclined had happened to come along while they
were occupying the porch the situation might
have been embarrassing. Amy made a valiant
effort to revive a finger alphabet they had used
in school to carry on extended conversations
across a school room. But though it had not
taken long for the girls to refresh their memories
of the letters, they found it much harder
work to converse after the fashion of the deaf
and dumb than it had seemed when they were
younger, and for the most part conversation
languished. They sat and sewed, each vaguely
cheered by the proximity of her fellow sufferers,
though all the time conscious that this was
an abnormally long week.</p>

<p>But long as the days were, each came to an
end in time. Amy had fallen in the way of apprising
Aunt Phoebe by post-card that another
day had been passed in silence. "Tell Mr.
Frost he might as well make out his check
now," she wrote at the conclusion of the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
day. "We haven't spoken yet, and now we've
learned the secret, there isn't the least danger
that any one will speak before the week is up."</p>

<p>As the days went by, the vigilance of the
girls increased instead of relaxing. Each
realized that a single inadvertent exclamation
from the lips of one would render vain the
effort and sacrifice of all. This realization got
rather on their nerves, and Ruth particularly,
showed it.</p>

<p>"It's the most absurd thing I ever heard of,"
declared Mr. Wylie at breakfast one morning,
as Ruth came downstairs heavy-eyed. "You
girls call yourselves college women, don't you?
This affair is worthy of a bunch of high-school
Freshmen."</p>

<p>"I think Ruth wants me to remind you,"
said Mrs. Wylie, as her daughter looked at her
appealingly, "that they mean to use the hundred
dollars in sending a little girl to school."</p>

<p>"But no man in his senses is going to pay
good money for anything like this. Who is he,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"A sort of Uncle of Amy's, didn't you say,
Ruth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>As Amy's relationship to Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back
was too complicated to explain
without the assistance of language, Ruth contented
herself with nodding.</p>

<p>"Probably he was only joking. A hundred
dollars is a hundred dollars, especially these
days. You oughtn't to have taken him
seriously, Ruth."</p>

<p>"I think Peggy is really responsible," remarked
Mrs. Wylie, with a rather mischievous
smile, for Mr. Wylie's admiration for his son's
fiancée was as outspoken as Graham's own.</p>

<p>"Is that so, Ruth?"</p>

<p>Ruth nodded.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say," declared Mr. Wylie,
pushing back his chair from the table, "is that
in this matter my future daughter-in-law
showed less than her usual good horse-sense."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to understand something
that always puzzled me," Peggy wrote Graham,
that same evening. "You know in mathematics
they talk about an <i>asymptote</i>, something
that something else is always approaching,
but never reaches. That always seemed
so foolish to me, to approach a thing continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and never get there. But now I understand.
Thursday is an asymptote."</p>

<p>But though Thursday loitered on the way, it
arrived at last, and four girls woke to the
realization that it was supremely important&mdash;the
day that either made void or confirmed the
success of the previous six. They spent the
morning characteristically. Ruth, who had felt
under the weather for a day or two, decided to
stay in bed, this being a safe refuge. Priscilla
took a basket of mending and retired to her
room. Peggy spent her time at her writing
desk and tried to collect some fugitive ideas
into a theme for her college English work in
the fall. Amy devoted herself to making a
cake with a very thick chocolate frosting.</p>

<p>It happened that this morning Amy had received
a postcard from Aunt Phoebe, the first
reply to her daily bulletins. "Glad to hear
you are getting on so well," wrote the old lady.
"P&mdash;&mdash; quite nervous." After the cake was
finished and the frosting hardening, Amy resolved
to take Aunt Phoebe's card over to
Peggy. While they could not talk it over, they
could exchange smiles, and probably a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ideas as well, through the medium of a lead
pencil. The luckless Amy picked up the post
card and started off in high spirits.</p>

<p>It happened that one of the houses on the
Terrace had been built with a slate roof, which
at the present time was undergoing repairs.
Amy, swinging lightly along the familiar way,
gained rapidly on an old man ahead who
walked very deliberately, apparently examining
the numbers of the houses. Amy
noticed that, although the sky was clear, he
carried a massive cotton umbrella.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was just opposite the
house which was being repaired, when one of
the workmen pulled out a broken slate and
without even looking behind him, flung it to the
street below. Amy saw the workman before
the slate left his hand, and some intuition
warned her of danger. "Look out!" she cried
shrilly, "Look out!"</p>

<p>The old man ahead dodged back. He was
none too quick, for the piece of slate, flying
through the air with the sharp edge down,
dropped where he had stood an instant before.
The old man took off his hat and ran his fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
through his hair. Amy saw it was Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back.</p>

<p>The discovery, interesting in itself, meant
nothing to Amy at the moment. She uttered a
heart-broken wail. She had spoken before the
week was up. By her impulsive exclamation
she had forfeited the hundred dollars. Though
she knew acknowledgment must be made to
her partners in the undertaking, since as she
had broken the spell the others were automatically
released from the obligation of
silence, to face any of them at that moment
seemed impossible. Without a word to Mr.
Frost, Amy wheeled about and started for
home, the tears running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Breathing hard, Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back
trotted after her. What he meant to
say does not matter, since the discovery that
Amy was in tears resulted in the inquiry,
"What are you crying for, hey?"</p>

<p>"I lost it," Amy sobbed. "I spoke."</p>

<p>Her companion seemed to be deliberating.
"I s'pose you mean the hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Of course I mean the hundred dollars. But
I don't see how I could have helped it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
couldn't walk on deliberately and see a sharp
piece of slate drop on a man's head."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/facing126.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="older man handing something to girl" />
<div class="caption">"'A HUNDRED DOLLARS AIN'T ANY TOO MUCH TO PAY
FOR HAVING YOUR LIFE SAVED'"</div>
</div>

<p>"I came in to-day thinking I'd have a talk
with that friend of yours," said Mr. Frost,
"seeing she seemed to be the head one in this
thing. I was going to tell her that now I'd
thought it over, my conscience wasn't quite
easy about this agreement of ourn. I'm afraid
it is too much like placing a bet."</p>

<p>Amy's jaw dropped as she looked at him.
Her tears dried instantly, the moisture evaporated
by the fires of her wrath. But either because
her usually ready tongue was out of
practise after six days of idleness, or because
the realization of the perfidy of the old man
produced a momentary paralysis of her vocal
chords, not a word escaped her parted lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, it didn't look right to me," Mr. Frost
continued. "It was the same as betting that
you four girls couldn't keep from talking for a
week. My conscience wouldn't let me be a
party to anything of that sort. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pause after the "but" was prolonged.
Amy searched her vocabulary for words that
would do justice to the occasion, but Uncle Philander-Behind-His-Back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was continuing before
she knew what she wanted to say.</p>

<p>"Having your life saved is a different thing.
That slate had an edge on it like a meat ax,
and coming through the air the way it was, it
would have cleft my head open like it had been
an egg shell. My widow could have got
damages all right, but that wouldn't have
helped me out."</p>

<p>They had reached Amy's door by now.
"Got pen and ink handy?" asked Mr. Frost,
with a marked change of manner.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Amy tonelessly, and opened the
door for him. She led the way to the writing
desk, and pointed out the articles he required.
Mr. Philander Frost, seating himself, wrote out
a check for a hundred dollars, payable to Amy
Lassell or order.</p>

<p>"There," he said as he reached for the
blotter. "Can't nobody no matter how sensitive
their consciences are, find any fault with
that. A hundred dollars ain't any too much to
pay for having your life saved."</p>

<p>And then the ink had a narrow escape from
being overturned, for Amy flung her arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
around the old gentleman's neck and hugged
him. "Uncle Philander!" she screamed,
"You're a prince."</p>

<p>And that is how little Myrtle Burns was
assured of her year in high school, and Uncle
Philander-Behind-His-Back was adopted, unreservedly,
by four unusually attractive nieces.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THE WORLD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nelson Hallowell</span> had something on his
mind. Ruth had discovered it early in the
evening. They had all gone over to Peggy's,
and there had been the usual amount of talk
and laughter, but Nelson had hardly spoken.
Every time she looked in his direction, Ruth
found his eyes upon her, and something in his
manner said as plainly as words could have told
it, that he was only waiting to get her alone to
impart some confidence of more than ordinary
importance. Ruth was not in the least inclined
to be self-conscious, but for some reason
his unwavering regard made her nervous. She
was glad when the clock struck ten and she
could take her leave.</p>

<p>Though Graham had lingered for a little talk
with Peggy, and Nelson and Ruth had the sidewalk
to themselves, the young man seemed in
no hurry to relieve his mind. Instead he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
walked at Ruth's side apparently absorbed in
thought. Ruth, waiting, half amused and half
vexed by his air of preoccupation, pinched her
lips tightly shut as she resolved not to be the
first to break the silence.</p>

<p>At the door of her home Nelson suddenly
roused himself. "May I come in for a little
while, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Nelson. It's Friday. No
classes to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There's something I want to talk to you
about," he said, and followed her indoors with
an air of summoning his resolution. As Ruth
turned on the lights in the living room, he drew
a letter from his pocket and handed it to her.
"I'd like to have you read that."</p>

<p>Ruth seated herself by the drop light, and
drew out the enclosure. It was folded so that
her eye fell at once on the signature. "Why,"
she exclaimed, "that's the nice soldier you got
acquainted with in the hospital."</p>

<p>"Yes. The fellow from Oklahoma, you
know."</p>

<p>Ruth unfolded the letter and began to read.
Immediately her expression underwent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
noticeable change. One would have said that
the letter annoyed her, though when at length
she lifted her eyes and met Nelson's expectant
look, she was laughing. "Did you ever hear of
anything so absurd!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Nelson cleared his throat. "If you look at
it in one way, it's quite an unusual chance.
You see he's willing to take me without any
capital&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he ever saw in you to
make him think you'd make a ranchman,"
Ruth exclaimed. "I can't imagine you as a
cowboy. I suppose," she added excusingly,
"that he's always been used to an out-door
life and it seems rather dreadful to him for any
one to be shut up in a book-store."</p>

<p>"It is rather dreadful."</p>

<p>Ruth gave a little start. For a moment she
was under an impression that she had not
heard Nelson aright, or else that he was joking.
And yet his voice had no suggestion of humor.
It was hoarse and curiously intense, and as she
looked at him, she saw that his face was unnaturally
flushed.</p>

<p>"Why, Nelson," she cried, "What are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
talking about? You can't mean that you don't
like your work."</p>

<p>Nelson looked at her appealingly. Without
realizing it, Ruth had spoken in a rather
peremptory fashion, and at once his sensitive
face showed his fear of having offended her.</p>

<p>"I used to think I liked it, Ruth."</p>

<p>"Used to! Why, Nelson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But now it's like being in a strait jacket.
I don't see how any fellow who was in the
service can ever get back to standing behind a
counter and be satisfied."</p>

<p>Again Ruth noticed the curious intensity of
his manner. She looked at the letter lying
upon the table with a feeling of irritation she
did not stop to analyze.</p>

<p>"Nelson, you don't mean you want to take
that offer? You wouldn't really like to go to
Oklahoma, would you? Why it's the jumping-off
place."</p>

<p>He sat looking at the floor. "I wanted to
know what you thought," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to say all I thought. Why, Nelson,
I don't believe it's ever occurred to you what it
would mean to your mother." Ruth herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had not thought of Mrs. Hallowell until that
instant, and she made up for her tardiness by
speaking very earnestly. "It would simply
kill her to have you off at the ends of the
earth."</p>

<p>"Mother's pretty game, you know." Nelson
smiled as if recalling something that had
pleased him particularly. "She says she
wouldn't mind a bit living in Oklahoma."</p>

<p>Ruth swallowed hard. Something in his
reminiscent smile added to her vexation.</p>

<p>"I should think you would know better than
to take her seriously. She'd die of homesickness.
But of course, if you've really set your
heart on going thousands of miles away from
all your friends, I wouldn't want to put anything
in your way."</p>

<p>"Ruth, you know I don't mean that." He
looked rather bewildered at her injustice. "I
haven't answered the letter. I just wanted to
know what you thought about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I think the whole thing is absurd. I
suppose you are a little restless after your
army life, but you'll get over that."</p>

<p>"I suppose I will," Nelson acknowledged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
He was so humble about it that Ruth promptly
forgave him for having given favorable consideration
to the offer of his friend in Oklahoma,
and was her usual pleasant self during
the remainder of his stay.</p>

<p>As far as Nelson was concerned, the matter
was dropped, but unluckily for Ruth's peace of
mind Peggy was yet to be heard from. The
next day was Saturday and Peggy dropped in
soon after breakfast.</p>

<p>"Ruth, what was the matter with Nelson last
evening? I never knew anybody to be so quiet.
I was afraid that perhaps something was said
that hurt his feelings. He's such a sensitive
fellow."</p>

<p>"No indeed, Peggy. It wasn't anything particular."
Ruth hesitated, uncertain whether
to let it go at that, or to explain the situation in
full. Her life-long habit of confiding in Peggy
proved more than a match for her undefined
hesitation, and she went on to tell of the letter
from Oklahoma with its preposterous offer.
She finished with a little contemptuous laugh,
but Peggy's face was grave.</p>

<p>"Did he want to go, Ruth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he&mdash;well, it seems, Peggy, that since
he got out of the service he's been sort of restless.
He got so used to outdoor life that he
doesn't enjoy indoor work. But I tell him
he'll get over that."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the downright Peggy,
looking straight at her friend, "that you feel
that you wouldn't want to live in Oklahoma."</p>

<p>Ruth jumped. Then as the blood rushed
tingling to the roots of her hair, she turned on
Peggy a look of intense indignation.</p>

<p>"Peggy Raymond, what on earth are you
talking about?"</p>

<p>Peggy sat without replying and Ruth continued
vehemently, "Of course I like Nelson
Hallowell; like him very much. I consider him
one of my very best friends. But that's all.
The very idea of your talking as if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Peggy, as Ruth came to a
halt, "you'd miss him if he went out West."</p>

<p>Ruth brightened. "Yes, that's just it. I'd
miss him terribly. I really think he's one of
the nicest boys I ever knew, and for all he's so
quiet, we have dandy times together. But as
for anything else&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you think," suggested Peggy, as
Ruth halted again, "that it seems a little bit unfair
to interfere with Nelson's future, just because
you like to have him dropping in every
day or two and because it's convenient to have
an escort whenever you want to go somewhere?"</p>

<p>Ruth found herself incapable of replying.
She sat staring at Peggy with a resentment
that she could not have concealed if she had
tried. And Peggy, quite unmoved by her
friend's indignation, continued judicially, "If
you were going to marry Nelson, you would
have a perfect right to help decide where he
should be located. But it's considerable of a
responsibility to persuade him to turn down an
offer like that, just because you're afraid
you're going to miss him if he goes away."</p>

<p>Ruth found her voice. "Nelson Hallowell
can do exactly as he pleases. He asked my advice
and I gave it, but he doesn't have to take it
unless he wants to."</p>

<p>"That's not fair, Ruth. However you feel
about it, you know perfectly well that Nelson
wants to please you more than anything in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
world. And besides, when a friend asks you
your advice, you're supposed to think of what
is best for him and not of what you want yourself."</p>

<p>"Really, Peggy," said Ruth rather witheringly,
"as long as Nelson is satisfied with my
advice, I can't see that any one else need take
it to heart."</p>

<p>Peggy colored. It was a fact that, relying on
long intimacy and close friendship, she had
said more to Ruth than she would have been
justified in saying to another girl. "Excuse
me, Ruth," she answered quickly. "I'm
afraid I was rather interfering."</p>

<p>The effect of this apology was peculiar.
Ruth burst into tears. "Oh, don't, Peggy,"
she sobbed. "Don't act as if it wasn't any
business of yours what I did."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," owned Peggy, "that I'm too
much inclined to think everything you do is my
business."</p>

<p>"No, you're not. We're just the same as
sisters. And it would kill me if you washed
your hands of me."</p>

<p>Peggy burst into a reassuring laugh. "Small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
danger of that, dearie. I'm likely to remain
Meddlesome Peggy to the end of the chapter,
as far as you're concerned. And I don't know
what you're crying for, Ruth."</p>

<p>Ruth was not quite sure herself, but she continued
to sob. "Do you think I ought to encourage
Nelson to go, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that. But it seems to me you
ought not to discourage him, unless you have
a good reason. And though I don't know much
about such things, it sounded to be like a wonderful
offer. What does Nelson think?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess he thought so, too, but I didn't
give him a chance to say much." Ruth dropped
her head upon Peggy's shoulder and sobbed.
"Oklahoma is such a dreadful way off."</p>

<p>"I know it is," Peggy patted her shoulder
tenderly. "I'd nearly cry my eyes out if anybody
I loved went there to live."</p>

<p>"Nelson is so good, Peggy. He wanted to
go, but he gave it up just as soon as he saw
I didn't like the idea. And I know he hates
that old book store."</p>

<p>Peggy continued to smile rather wistfully
and to pat the heaving shoulders while Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
prattled on. "I'm awfully selfish, I know.
It's just as you said. I never gave a thought
to what was best for him."</p>

<p>"I never said that, Ruth, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Well, it's so, anyway. I wonder if he's answered
that letter yet. I'm going to call up
and see."</p>

<p>Ruth had no need to look in the telephone
book to find the number of Flynn's
book store. As the hour was early, Nelson
himself answered the call. His politely interrogative
tone changed markedly as in response
to his, "Hello," Ruth said, "It's I,
Nelson."</p>

<p>"Ruth! Why, good morning!"</p>

<p>"Have you answered that letter from Oklahoma?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, Ruth. But never mind that
letter. We won't talk about it any more."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to ask you not to answer it
till we'd talked it over again, Nelson."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. "I don't see the use
of that. I wanted to see how you really felt
about it, and now I've found out."</p>

<p>"Well, don't answer it right away. That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
all. Are you coming up to-night, Nelson?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>Ruth smiled faintly at the emphatic syllable.
"Good-by," she said, then sighed as she hung
up the receiver. "Well, it's all right," she
told the waiting Peggy. "I haven't done any
mischief that I can't undo."</p>

<p>But when Nelson came that evening he proved
unexpectedly obdurate. He showed an extreme
reluctance to re-open the subject of the Oklahoma
proposition, and roused Ruth's indignation
by hinting that the matter did not concern
Peggy Raymond, and he could not see any reason
for her "butting in." And when sternly
called to order for this bit of heresy, he still
showed himself unwilling to talk of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he burst out suddenly.
"I know how you feel about it. I&mdash;I&mdash;It's
awfully hard explaining, Ruth, when I haven't
any right to&mdash;to say how I feel&mdash;but the long
and short of it is I wouldn't go to any place
where you wouldn't live."</p>

<p>He stopped, his face scarlet as he realized all
his statement implied. Nelson was keenly conscious
of his own disadvantages. Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
would soon be in a position to support a family,
but the salary Mr. Flynn paid his competent
clerk made a wife seem an impossible luxury.
Nelson regarded Ruth as the bright particular
star of the Friendly Terrace quartette. He
considered her prettier than Peggy, wittier
than Amy, and more talented than Priscilla.
For him to aspire to be the first in her heart
was the height of presumption, in Nelson's
opinion, and yet he had just said to her in
effect that he would not go to any place where
she would not go with him. Despairingly he
realized how poorly his presumptuous speech
had expressed his attitude of worshipful
humility.</p>

<p>Then he became aware that Ruth was looking
at him from the other side of the table, and
that her manner lacked the indignation appropriate
to the occasion. She held her head
very high, and her eyes were like stars. Nelson
suddenly experienced a difficulty in breathing.
His heart was beating more rapidly than it had
ever beaten under fire. He heard himself
asking a question, the audacity of which
astounded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wouldn't think of it, would you, Ruth,
going out to that rough cattle country, a girl
like you?"</p>

<p>He did not realize the desperation in his
voice as he put the question, but its appeal went
straight to Ruth's heart. She answered unhesitatingly.
"The place wouldn't matter,
Nelson. Everything would depend on the one&mdash;the
one I went with."</p>

<p>It was not an opportune time for Graham to
walk into the room. And it argued him obtuse,
that instead of realizing he was in the way, he
seated himself in the easy chair, and proceeded
to discuss a variety of subjects. Once or twice
Nelson's answers suggested that his mind was
wandering, and small wonder. For when the
most wonderful thing in the world has just
happened, it is hard on any young fellow to be
held up and forced to give his views on universal
training.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>MISTRESS AND MAID</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A careworn</span>, anxious expression had come to
be so much at home on Priscilla's countenance,
that it did not surprise Peggy to look from her
window one Saturday morning and see Priscilla
approaching, her face so lined by worry as to
suggest that the heaviest responsibilities rested
on her shoulders. As she was quite unconscious
of Peggy's observation, she did not make
her usual effort to smile and appear natural.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what ailed that girl," thought
Peggy, studying Priscilla's changed countenance
with a heart-sick concern. "She looks
years older than she did six months ago, and I
can't make out whether she's sick or just unhappy.
And the worst of it is that one can't
get a thing out of her."</p>

<p>But in this particular instance Peggy was to
have no reason to complain of Priscilla's reticence.
As Priscilla raised her heavy eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
saw her friend's face at the window, her own
face brightened and she quickened her steps.
Peggy hurried to the door, and flung it open
with an unreasonable hope that this interview
would end the mystery which had baffled her
for so long. But the perplexity Priscilla had
come to confide was too recent to explain her
worried air through the months past. She was
hardly in the house before she burst out,
"Peggy, I'm in an awful pickle."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Can I help!"</p>

<p>"I wondered if you would lend me Sally."</p>

<p>"Sally?" repeated Peggy in accents of
astonishment. For the maid-of-all-work in the
Raymond household was a possession of which
few people were envious. Whether Sally was
really weak minded was a question on which a
difference of opinion was possible, but there
was no possible doubt of her talent for doing
the wrong thing at the right time or else, vice
versa, the right thing at the wrong time. Her
one redeeming feature was her amiability, but
as this frequently took a conversational turn, it
was not without its drawbacks. That any of
her friends could want to borrow Sally, or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
any household but their own would put up with
the blundering, good-natured apology for a
domestic servant, had never entered Peggy's
head.</p>

<p>"Sally," she repeated, still in a tone of mystification.
"Of course you can have her if you
want her, but whatever it is, she'll do it wrong."</p>

<p>"I suppose she could open the door for a
caller, couldn't she?"</p>

<p>"Why, she can open a door, as a rule, but
just now she's got a tooth-ache, and her head
is tied up in a red flannel, so unless the callers
are people of strong nerves, they may be
startled."</p>

<p>"O dear!" Priscilla's acceptance of this bit
of information was so suggestive of tragedy
that Peggy was more puzzled than ever.
"Who is the caller?" she demanded. "And
why in the world do you want Sally?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's quite a story, Peggy. You know
Mother's away this week and Martha's having
her vacation, and Father and I are taking our
meals at the Lindsays. And last evening
Horace Hitchcock called, and it seems that an
aunt of his is in town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peggy. She always made desperate
efforts to act just as usual when
Horace's name was mentioned, but under such
circumstances she invariably felt as if a thick
curtain had dropped between her friend and
herself. "Horace Hitchcock's aunt," she repeated,
trying valiantly to speak naturally.
"Is she his mother's sister or his father's?"</p>

<p>"Neither one. She's his father's aunt, and
of course she is quite old and very rich, and it
seems she's coming out to call on me."</p>

<p>"To call on you," Peggy exclaimed. "How
interesting!"</p>

<p>But that adjective registered an exception to
Peggy's usual frankness. Had she spoken her
real feelings she would have said, "How dreadful!"
For a call from the young man's great-aunt
seemed to imply that the young man's
intentions were serious, and recognized by the
family. Horace and Priscilla! Peggy stifled
a groan.</p>

<p>"And you see the fix I'm in," Priscilla was
explaining disconsolately. "Of course she's
used to butlers and everything, and here I've
got to go to open the door myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy listened wonderingly. For even if
Horace Hitchcock had been an entirely different
young man, the necessity for opening the door
to his great-aunt would not have impressed her
as a tragedy. Priscilla's intuition told her
what was passing through the other girl's
mind, and she spoke a little fretfully.</p>

<p>"Of course it's silly to mind, Peggy, but I <i>do</i>
mind, just the same. Mrs. Duncan has a houseful
of servants, and she thinks of women who
answer their own door-bell as we think of
women who take in washing." Priscilla's
feeling of resentment at Peggy was enhanced
by her own wonder at herself. The glamor
which had surrounded Horace in the first renewal
of their childish acquaintance had quite
disappeared, and yet she could not bear the
thought that Horace's great-aunt might look
down upon her.</p>

<p>"Sally wouldn't be the least bit of good,"
Peggy declared, "even if it wasn't for the red
flannel. Just when I want Sally to be on her
good behavior, she does some perfectly unheard-of
thing. When do you expect Mrs.
Duncan?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, sometime this forenoon. Horace
thought about eleven. And that's another
thing that puzzles me," exclaimed Priscilla unhappily.
"Ought I to dress up, do you think,
as long as I'm expecting a call?"</p>

<p>"I'd wear my blue serge, if I were you. Blue
serge is always safe and, besides, you look
awfully well in that dress. And you need not
worry about the maid. I'm it."</p>

<p>"Why, Peggy, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't insult me by asking for Sally, and
then pretending that I won't do. I've got a
black dress and a cute little ruffled apron, and
I'm just aching to try my hand at one of those
fetching caps the maids wear in the movies."</p>

<p>"But, Peggy, suppose Horace should come
with his aunt!"</p>

<p>"You don't expect him, do you?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm sure he didn't plan to come last
evening. But he might change his mind."</p>

<p>"We'll keep on the look-out. If we see a
lady arriving with a young man in tow, I'll
roll my cap and apron into a bundle and put
them under my arm. Then I'll be your friend,
Peggy Raymond, making a morning call. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
if the lady is alone, I'm Margaret, the maid."</p>

<p>Priscilla was hardly arrayed in her blue
serge when Peggy arrived, and the two girls
inspected each other admiringly. The Plainness
of the blue serge set off the long lines of
Priscilla's slender, graceful figure, while the
little frilled, nonsensical cap gave a charm to
Peggy's mischievous face. "You look like a
queen," Peggy declared.</p>

<p>"And you're darling in that cap. I'm afraid
she'll suspect something the minute she sees
you."</p>

<p>Mistress and maid were sitting comfortably
side by side in the dining-room when the door-bell
rang. Peggy started to her feet, but Priscilla
clutched her arm. "Don't go far, will
you, Peggy."</p>

<p>"I don't want to appear to be eavesdropping,
ma'am."</p>

<p>"Nonsense: you can pretend to be dusting
something out here. I don't want you to go
away." Priscilla was experiencing a panic at
the thought of being left to the tender mercies
of Horace Hitchcock's great-aunt. She needed
the close proximity of Peggy to give her confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace had not accompanied Mrs. Duncan.
She stood upon the steps, a little withered
woman, rather elaborately dressed, and she
inspected Peggy through her lorgnette. "Is
Miss Combs in?" she inquired, after finishing
her leisurely scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I think so, Madame. Please walk in."
Peggy ushered the caller into the front room
and brought a tray for her card. Her cheeks
had flushed under Mrs. Duncan's inspection.
The small, beady eyes in the wrinkled face had
a curiously piercing quality, and she wondered
uneasily whether this remarkable old woman
could possibly have recognized that she was
only masquerading.</p>

<p>She carried the card upstairs to Priscilla
who had retreated to her room, the prey of
nerves, and brought back word that Miss Combs
would be down in a few minutes. Then she
retired to the adjoining room and began on her
dusting. She was not sorry Priscilla had insisted
that she be near, for she was extremely
curious to hear what the visitor was going to
say.</p>

<p>Priscilla followed Peggy in something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
half a minute, and greeted her caller sweetly,
though with some constraint. Mrs. Duncan
looked her over approvingly. "You're not as
pretty as I expected," was her disconcerting
beginning.</p>

<p>In the next room Peggy gasped. Priscilla
drew herself up and blushed crimson.</p>

<p>"What I meant to say," explained the terrible
old woman, "is that you're not as pretty as
I expected, but much handsomer. I took it for
granted Horace would admire some namby-pamby
with a doll's face. I suppose you know
you're a very striking type, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I've thought much about it,"
prevaricated Priscilla.</p>

<p>"And you're going to college," continued
Mrs. Duncan. "What's your idea in that? I
suppose you know that if you marry Horace,
you ought not to know too much."</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Duncan&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Priscilla's caller was off at a tangent.
"You've got a nice-looking maid? Have you
any brothers?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Priscilla mechanically. "I'm
an only child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you're married, Miss Combs, take an
old woman's advice and never have an attractive
maid about the house. My married life of
twenty years was reasonably successful," explained
Mrs. Duncan complacently, "and I lay
it all to my habit of selecting maids who were
either cross-eyed or else pock-marked."</p>

<p>Priscilla felt that she hated her, but as she
struggled to conceal her inhospitable emotion,
her visitor inquired blandly, "What do you and
Horace talk about?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;Oh, about all sorts of things."
Priscilla wondered if ever in her life she had
appeared as inane and stupid as on this momentous
occasion.</p>

<p>"I can't understand him, you know," explained
Mrs. Duncan, rubbing her nose.
"Sometimes I think it's because I'm a fool,
and sometimes I think it's because he's a fool.
I dare say you've felt the same uncertainty.
But we'd better talk of something else, so you
won't look to conscious when he arrives."</p>

<p>"Arrives?" repeated Priscilla blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's to lunch with me down town. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
suggested that I would enjoy taking him to&mdash;what's
the name of the place? Oh, well, he'll
know. Perhaps you'll join us."</p>

<p>Priscilla declined fervently. Without saying
it in so many words, she gave the impression
that she had a most imperative engagement for
the afternoon. As she voiced her stammering
refusal, she felt like a criminal on the verge of
exposure. For when the bell rang Peggy would
answer it, and Horace would at once recognize
that Priscilla's attractive maid was no other
than Priscilla's bosom friend.</p>

<p>But Peggy, dusting industriously in the adjoining
room, had overheard the news that had
carried consternation to Priscilla's soul, and
acted upon the hint with characteristic promptness.
A moment later she appeared in the
doorway, waiting unobtrusively till Priscilla
looked in her direction. And then she said respectfully,
"Miss Priscilla."</p>

<p>Priscilla struggled to play her part. "Yes&mdash;Margaret?"</p>

<p>"I haven't done the marketing yet. If you
can spare me for a little while, I'll attend to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, Margaret," replied Priscilla
with boundless relief.</p>

<p>As Peggy disappeared, Mrs. Duncan leaned
forward and tapped Priscilla's knee. "I tell
you she's too good to be true," she insisted.
"She's too pretty, too well-mannered. There's
something wrong somewhere. Don't trust
her." And Priscilla had to conquer the impression
that it was her friend Peggy who was
being slandered, before she could assume the
nonchalant manner suited to the statement that
they had always found Margaret a most trustworthy
girl.</p>

<p>Horace arrived some fifteen minutes after
Peggy's departure, and his apologies to his
great-aunt were more profuse than his slight
tardiness called for. Indeed, as Priscilla
watched his manner toward the domineering
old lady, she was unpleasantly reminded that
Mrs. Duncan was a rich widow, and that Horace
might cherish the hope of inheriting at least
a portion of her wealth. Priscilla had all the
contempt of a normal American girl for a fortune-hunter,
and her lover had never appeared
to less advantage in her eyes than in his obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
efforts to please his eccentric relative.
In her revolt from Horace's methods she went a
little too far in the other direction, and her
manner as she parted from her guest was frigid
rather than friendly. Mrs. Duncan's call was
the first indication that Horace's people were
aware of his intentions, and Priscilla had a not
unreasonable feeling of resentment at being
inspected to see if she would do. Although
the door had been opened for Mrs. Duncan
by a correctly appointed maid, Priscilla was
miserably conscious that the call had not been
a success, and that her unfavorable impression
of Horace's great-aunt was probably returned
by that terrible old person with something to
spare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>QUITE INFORMAL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amy's</span> memorable dinner party, which had
resulted in making Bob Carey such a frequent
caller, was responsible for another agreeable
friendship. Bob's sister Hildegarde, if she did
not fully share her brother's sentiments where
Amy was concerned, acknowledged, nevertheless,
to a thorough liking for the girl who had
played the part of hostess under such trying
circumstances. She saw considerable of Amy
and, through her, had made the acquaintance
of Amy's especial chums on Friendly Terrace.
The girls all liked Hildegarde, and Hildegarde
liked them, though she was continually accusing
them of being old-fashioned in their ideas.
Hildegarde had rather more spending money
than was good for her, and her social ambitions
were the bane of Bob's existence. Bob hated
formality. He never put on his dress suit
except under protest, and his popularity among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his sister's friends, with the resulting invitations
to all sorts of affairs, awakened his
profound resentment. The simple good times
of Amy's set where every one came at eight
o'clock and went home at ten, exactly suited him.</p>

<p>There was perhaps a spice of malice back of
an invitation Amy received one morning. The
previous evening Bob had accompanied his sister
to the home of one of her friends. He had
gone reluctantly, only yielding when Hildegarde
had agreed to start for home promptly at ten.
There had been other callers, however, and
bridge had been suggested, so that it was quarter
of one when the brother and sister reached
home. Bob was frankly sulky. "I hate to go
down to the office in the morning feeling like a
fool because I haven't had sleep enough," he
declared.</p>

<p>"Bob Carey, any one would suppose you were
an old grandfather to hear you talk. I don't
know another fellow your age who thinks he
has to go to bed with the chickens."</p>

<p>"And knowing the hours some of your
friends keep," returned Bob irritatingly, "I'm
not surprised at their seeming lack of intelligence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
They're practically walking in their
sleep."</p>

<p>"Please leave my friends alone. You
wouldn't be particularly pleased if I began
sneering at Amy."</p>

<p>"Sneering at Amy!" Bob's tone was scornful
as he repeated his sister's words. "If you
did, it would be only to get even with me."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose she's absolute perfection."</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, don't be so absurd." But though
Hildegarde ended with a laugh, she was still
resentful. She knew that Bob had planned to
call on Amy that evening and shrewdly judged
that, since she had thwarted his intention, he
would go the following night. Accordingly she
called Amy on the phone bright and early, and
invited her to attend a down-town picture show;
not an ordinary movie, but a special attraction
with the seats selling at regular theater prices.
Amy exclaimed delightedly, and then caught
herself up.</p>

<p>"I forgot that Peggy and Priscilla were
coming over to-night. But I'm sure they'll let
me off. I'll call them up and then call you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
I'm crazy to see that picture, but I didn't expect
to for a year or two till it got down to the
twenty-five cent houses."</p>

<p>"We'll ask Peggy and Priscilla to go, too,"
said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Gorgeous," replied Amy, "and it's so near
the end of vacation we can make it a final
spree"; and Hildegarde, smiling a little,
proceeded to call the two Sweet P's as
she mentally designated them. Both girls
were unqualifiedly delighted to accept, for
one of the advantages of not possessing too
much money is that the zest for simple pleasures
remains keen. Hildegarde had friends who
were blasé over a trip to Europe, and she
always felt a little wonder, not without a tinge
of patronage it must be admitted, over the
thoroughness with which Amy and her friends
could enjoy things.</p>

<p>When Hildegarde announced casually at the
dinner table that she would have to be excused
before the desert, as she and Amy were to see
the "Star of Destiny" that evening, her brother
shot her a comprehending glance. "I'd have
bought a ticket for you, Bob," Hildegarde explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
teasingly, "Only I felt sure you meant
to go to bed at nine, and make up the sleep you
lost last evening."</p>

<p>"You're always thoughtful, Hildegarde,"
said Bob with an irony so apparent that his
mother stared. And Hildegarde hurrying
through her dinner, felt cheerful certainty that
as far as her brother was concerned, she had
evened the score.</p>

<p>The "Star of Destiny" proved quite as thrilling
as any of the audience could have wished,
and the accompanying comedy a trifle less inane
than the average picture comedy. At ten
o'clock the girls left the theater, while the
crowd that had been standing in line scrambled
to take the seats they had vacated. As they
reached the sidewalk, Hildegarde slipped her
hand through the arm of Priscilla, who happened
to be nearest, "I'm on the point of
starvation," she declared gaily. "I had to
hurry through my dinner so, I feel as though
I hadn't had a thing. Now we'll go over to the
Green Parrot and get something to eat."</p>

<p>The guests hesitated. "Is&mdash;do you think
it is all right for girls to go there alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in the evening?" asked Peggy doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Why of course. The name's rather lurid,
but it's a perfectly nice place. Let's take this
cross-street and then we'll save half a block."</p>

<p>On the way to the popular restaurant, Hildegarde
did most of the talking. None of her
guests felt exactly comfortable over accepting
the invitation; and yet to decline it, when Hildegarde
declared herself half starved, seemed decidedly
ungracious. None of the Friendly
Terrace girls had been brought up to think a
chaperone a necessary accompaniment to all
youthful pleasures, but venturing into a down-town
restaurant at ten o'clock in the evening,
without either chaperone or escort, was rather
too up-to-date to please any of them. Peggy
pictured Graham's face when she told him of
the climax of the evening's pleasures, and
smiled rather ruefully.</p>

<p>Once inside, it must be admitted, the spirits
of all three revived. The big room was so
lighted that it was more dazzling than the noon
day. A space had been cleared for dancing,
and several couples were revolving in time to a
catchy popular air. The majority of the tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were occupied, but the head-waiter, who evidently
recognized Hildegarde, led the way to a
small round table at the side, and seated them
with a flourish. No one had seemed to notice
them, and Peggy hoped that their inconspicuous
location would prevent any unwelcome
attention.</p>

<p>"After all," she thought sensibly, "it's a
perfectly respectable place, and perhaps it's
not considered queer for girls to come alone."
Unconsciously her fear of arousing unfavorable
comment rendered her unusually subdued,
and the other girls took their cue from her,
speaking in their lowest voices, smiling discreetly,
and otherwise conducting themselves
with as much decorum as if there had been a
chaperone apiece.</p>

<p>After some discussion they decided on welsh
rarebit, and Hildegarde also ordered coffee and
rolls. The rarebit came in due time, an island
of toast in a seething lava-lake of rarebit.
The girls sniffed appreciatively and exchanged
smiles. "To think I didn't know I was
hungry," Amy exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I wish I could make my rarebits smooth like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
this," sighed Peggy. "It looks so wonderful
that I hate to eat it."</p>

<p>Their faces cheerful, but their manners still
decorously subdued, the four girls attacked the
dainty which has so undesirable a reputation
in the matter of dreams. Though Hildegarde
was the only one of the four who had not done
justice to her dinner, all were young enough
to feel hungry at the sight of the tempting dish.
The islands of toast vanished as if submerged
by a tidal wave. The miniature lava lakes
gradually disappeared, and the big plate of rolls
was so diminished by successive onslaughts
that the few remaining had a lonely look.</p>

<p>Priscilla was buttering the end of her roll
when, in involuntary emphasis of something she
was saying, she pressed it more energetically
than she realized. As if determined to escape
the fate of its comrades, the fragment flew
from her fingers. It cleared the space between
that table and the next as if it had been
winged, and then made sure of escape by
dropping in the coffee cup of a young man in
eye glasses, who was composedly eating fried
oysters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man looked up, startled as a
splash of coffee on his cheek challenged his attention.
He looked about in all directions and
at length his inquiring gaze came to the table
where sat the agonized Priscilla. Here, alas!
it halted. For as she had seen the bewildering
gyrations of the fragment of Priscilla's roll,
Amy had burst into an astonished giggle and had
continued to giggle without cessation. Hildegarde,
too, had lost interest in the remnant of
her meal, and sat leaning her head on her hand,
speechless with laughter. As for Peggy and
Priscilla, they were looking at each other in
silent stupefaction, their flaming cheeks seemingly
proclaiming their guilt. It was no
wonder the young man in eye-glasses looked no
farther. He had found the ones responsible.</p>

<p>For an agonizing moment Priscilla sat uncertain
what to do. Then summoning her common
sense to her aid, she turned to the sole occupant
of the next table. "I am very sorry,"
she said with that dignity that was Priscilla's
own. "A piece of roll slipped from my fingers
when I was buttering it, and flew across to your
table. It&mdash;it is in your coffee cup."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man looked into his cup and perceived
the floating fragment. When again he
lifted his eyes to Priscilla's he was smiling.
"I thought some acquaintance had thrown
something at me to attract my attention," he
explained.</p>

<p>"No," said Priscilla. "It was an unfortunate
accident. I beg your pardon."
And then she turned to her own coffee, and
seemingly gave it her attention, though so intense
was her excitement that she might as
well have been drinking warm water as the
coffee for which the Green Parrot was famous.</p>

<p>Peggy was proud of the dignity with which
Priscilla had met a difficult situation, but poor
Priscilla was not to find it easy to preserve that
dignity. Amy was still giggling, her face
wearing an expression of suffering, due to the
exhausting effect of continuous laughter.
Across the table Hildegarde pressed her handkerchief
to her eyes and moaned softly. And
all at once it seemed to Priscilla that she must
shriek with laughter or die.</p>

<p>A moment later Peggy uttered an ejaculation
of consternation, for the tears were running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
down Priscilla's cheeks. She sat perfectly
erect, her eyes upon the table, and her only
sign of emotion those tell-tale tears. Peggy
was really alarmed.</p>

<p>"Priscilla, you mustn't take it so to heart.
It wasn't anything. Don't cry."</p>

<p>"But I must do something," responded Priscilla
in a strangled voice. "Oh, can't we get
away?"</p>

<p>Her laughing companions sobered at the discovery
that Priscilla was in tears. Hildegarde
called the waiter and demanded her
check. But before they could get away, the
young man in eye-glasses had risen and crossed
to their table.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not worrying about that
roll," he said, looking down dismayed at Priscilla's
tear-wet cheeks. "It's not worth thinking
of twice, you know."</p>

<p>Seeing that Priscilla was incapable of replying,
Peggy came to her friend's assistance.
"Of course it was only an accident," she said,
"But it made her a little nervous."</p>

<p>"So I see. I'm terribly sorry. If I could
be of any service&mdash;" The young man's face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was troubled, his manner earnest. Peggy appreciated
the sincerity of his feeling, even while
she longed to take him by the ear and lead him
to the door. For heads were turning in their
direction from all over the room. They were
the observed of all observers.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," said Peggy hastily, "she
will feel all right as soon as she gets outside.
This room is so warm," she added rather
inanely. To her enormous relief the waiter
appeared with Hildegarde's change. Hildegarde
tipped him extravagantly, rammed her
remaining bills into her purse, and all four
girls started for the door. The young man
with the eye-glasses remained standing, staring
after them, and Peggy's cheeks crimsoned as
she realized the attention they were attracting.</p>

<p>She was quite sure she had a case of hysterics
on her hands when, once outside, Priscilla began
to laugh. It started in a little smothered
giggle which soon had developed into peals of
laughter. Peggy was terrified. "Priscilla,"
she cried, "for Heaven's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Amy who had begun laughing sympathetically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as soon as Priscilla started off, checked
herself to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Let her alone, Peggy. All that ails her is
she wanted to laugh and couldn't, and I don't
know anything that hurts worse. Isn't that it,
Priscilla?"</p>

<p>Priscilla could not answer in words, but she
nodded vehemently and laughed and wiped her
wet eyes and laughed on till she sobbed. And
then all at once she stopped short, drew a long
breath, and exclaimed, "I feel better."</p>

<p>They made their way to the street cars, discussing
the late unpleasantness with much animation
and making use of many lurid adjectives.
It was Hildegarde who exclaimed,
"Don't you wish you knew who he was?"
She referred, of course, to the young man in
eye-glasses.</p>

<p>Priscilla stiffened. "Mercy, no! I hope he
was a stranger in town, stopping over a train,
and that I'll never lay eyes on him again."</p>

<p>But that wish, though it came from the
depths of Priscilla's heart, was not destined to
come true.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>GOOD-BY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">College</span> had opened; but they had slipped
into it so quietly that there hardly seemed to be
a break. For Peggy and Priscilla, perhaps,
there was a bit of a pang at the realization that
this was the last year of what would probably
be one of the sweetest periods in their lives to
look back on; and they privately vowed to make
it rich in experience and the beauty of living.
Ruth and Amy, like Southey's brother who said
that "no young man believes that he will ever
die," felt that college life would never, could
never, end. So a week after the beginning of
classes found the four girls trying conscientiously
to live in the present, and stifling vague,
tantalizing memories of the past three months.</p>

<p>A number of letters passed between Nelson
Hallowell and his friend in Oklahoma before
the great step was decided on. And it must
be confessed that in the meantime Ruth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
college work suffered. Nelson came almost
every evening to pour into her attentive ears the
story of his hopes and ambitions, and Ruth
listened with the happy confidence that her approval
meant more to him than to any one in
the world.</p>

<p>Ruth and Nelson were living in an enchanted
world, where perfect understanding took the
place of speech. Nelson did not feel himself
at liberty to say to her the thing that was constantly
in his thoughts. The salary Mr. Flynn
had paid him had not enabled him to save any
money, and his venture in Oklahoma, promising
as he believed it, was, after all, only a venture,
with a possibility of failure. Nelson knew that
he himself was bound fast and irrevocably, but
he wanted to leave Ruth free as air. Yet he
talked to her with the assurance that she knew
all he was in honor bound not to say, and her
look, as she listened, confirmed that certainty.</p>

<p>Those weeks during which the matter was
being settled were a happy time for both of
them. Youth has a way of making the most of
a present joy, regardless of what the future
has in store, and while this seems very short-sighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to some older people, who can always
look ahead far enough to be miserable, the
young will probably continue to enjoy to-day's
sunshine&mdash;regardless of the weather prognosticator,
who assures them of a storm in the
middle of the week with a drop in temperature.
Nelson and Ruth saw as much of each other as
they could, and looked no further than a happiness
born of a confidence and understanding.</p>

<p>But the thing was settled at last, and the
generous offer of Nelson's soldier friend
definitely accepted. Nelson gave Mr. Flynn
notice, and that irritable gentleman promptly
lost his temper, and accused his reliable clerk
of folly and ingratitude. Later he realized his
mistake, and offered to raise his salary. But
Nelson was as little moved by Mr. Flynn's
smiles as he had been by his frowns, and Mr.
Flynn promptly relapsed into his former irascibility.</p>

<p>"The war spoiled a lot of you young fellows.
You're sick of hard work. Loafing is the only
thing that appeals to you."</p>

<p>"I never heard," laughed Nelson, "that life
on a cattle ranch was considered a soft snap."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't, you'll soon give it up," said
Mr. Flynn disagreeably. "An easy berth is
what you're looking for, and it's my opinion
that you'll look some time before you find it."</p>

<p>The next two weeks fairly flew. Nelson was
getting his necessary outfit, and every afternoon,
on the way home, he stopped to exhibit to
Ruth his latest purchases. And now the time
had come when it was hard for Ruth to smile
and show the proper interest. Sometimes
when she remembered that the decision had
been left to her, and that she had brought this
on herself, her heart almost failed her. It
would have been so much easier to have gone
on in the old way. The thought of the
thousands of miles that would soon stretch between
Nelson and herself gave her a weak feeling
in the knees. They had a great deal to say
in those days about letters but each realized,
only two well, that the best letter ever penned
is a poor substitute for the exchange of speech
and of smiles.</p>

<p>The day of Nelson's departure Ruth went
through the customary routine with a curious
sense of unreality. She had suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Nelson's coming to dinner, but he had declined,
and she would never know what that refusal
cost him.</p>

<p>"I'd love to, Ruth. You don't know how I'd
love to. But I think I should take my last meal
with mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, Nelson, I think so, too."</p>

<p>"She says she won't go down to the station to
see me off," Nelson went on. "She's been
keen about my going from the start, but now
that it's come to the point, it's harder than she
thought."</p>

<p>Ruth reflected that she could sympathize with
Mrs. Hallowell perfectly.</p>

<p>"The train goes at ten," Nelson continued
with a sprightly air that would not have deceived
the most gullible, "so I'll have plenty of
time to bore you stiff before you see the last of
me."</p>

<p>Ruth forced the smile his jest demanded.
"You know we're all going to the station with
you," she said. "Even Bob Carey's coming."</p>

<p>"I hope that Hitchcock won't show up," exclaimed
Nelson apprehensively.</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. "No, I don't think Horace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
expects to honor us. Isn't it the queerest
thing," she added, "what Priscilla can see in
him?"</p>

<p>"I should say so. Priscilla's one of the
finest girls you'd meet in a day's journey, and
Hitchcock is a nut. I shouldn't think she could
stand it to have him around. Though I suppose,"
concluded Nelson with customary
modesty, "that Priscilla thinks just the same
about you and me."</p>

<p>"Priscilla! She wouldn't dare." Ruth's
indignation was so intense that Nelson shouted
with laughter, but it warmed his heart, nevertheless.</p>

<p>In that last quick-moving Saturday, Ruth
saw Nelson for a few moments in the morning,
and again about three in the afternoon. His
stay was short and rather unsatisfactory for he
had some last errands to attend to, and his
mind was so full of them that his thoughts
wandered from what he was saying, and he
left his sentences unfinished in the most irritating
fashion.</p>

<p>After he had answered a question of Ruth's
in a way which showed he had hardly heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
what she had said, he looked up quickly at her
half-vexed exclamation, laughed, and jumped
to his feet.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Ruth," he said. "I'm one of
the fellows who's good for only one thing at a
time. I'll attend to these thousand-and-one
things that have been left over, and I'll see you
about eight o 'clock to-night. That will give us
time for a nice little visit."</p>

<p>Up till that time the hours had fairly flown.
Now they dragged. Ruth watched the clock
and waited for the tiresome, leisurely hour
hand to point to eight. The clan was to gather
at a little after nine, and she was thankful when
Graham departed for Peggy's shortly after
finishing dinner. Peggy would keep him till the
last minute. Peggy would understand. Ruth
had taken great pains in dusting the living-room
that morning, and she looked around it
thinking that it made a picture of cosy comfort
Nelson might be glad to carry with him.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock at last. Ruth straightened
a book on the table, brushed a speck of
dust from her gown, and sat down facing the
door. There were quick steps on the side walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and she never doubted that they would come on
up the walk, and then up the steps, and she
meant to have the door open before he had time
to ring. But the footsteps went on and the
minute hand of the clock was also moving.</p>

<p>At quarter past eight Ruth was nervous.
She got up and down, adjusted the window
shades, changed the arrangement of the chairs,
fussed with the flowers on the mantel, looked at
herself in the mirror, and did something to her
hair. At half past eight she sat very still,
frowning slightly and biting her lip. At
quarter of nine her cheeks had reddened and
she tapped the carpet with the toe of her shoe.
And at nine o'clock her heart gave a jump and
she forgot how near she had come to being
angry. For the footsteps for which she had
waited were coming up the walk.</p>

<p>"Hello!" It was Priscilla's voice. "Don't
tell me I'm the first one."</p>

<p>"The others will be here in a minute," Ruth
replied in an even voice. "Come right in and
take off your coat, Priscilla, for this room's
awfully warm."</p>

<p>Priscilla complied with her friend's suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and glanced at her admiringly. She
thought she had never seen Ruth look so pretty.
"You've got a lovely color to-night," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's just because it's so hot here. I always
get flushed when I'm warm."</p>

<p>Priscilla was looking around the room as
if in search of something. "Why, where's
Nelson?"</p>

<p>"He'll be here right away. You know there
are always so many things to be attended to in
the last few minutes." But though Ruth
gave this explanation with a matter-of-fact
cheerfulness that deceived even Priscilla who
knew her so well, she was seething inwardly.
So this was all he cared. He had sacrificed their
quiet hour together. Now there would be a
crush and a crowd and everybody talking at
once, and no chance to say any of the things
she had saved up for their last evening.</p>

<p>Not that she cared. Ruth flung up her head
and laughed gaily at something Priscilla was
telling. Her hands were cold and her mouth
felt very dry, and her heart was pounding
furiously. Nelson could come when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ready, and so that he didn't miss the train, it
made no difference to her.</p>

<p>Amy and Bob were next to arrive. Then
came Peggy and Graham. "Nelson's late,
isn't he?" said Peggy with an uneasy glance
at the clock. "He hasn't any time to spare."</p>

<p>"I'll put on my things so we'll all be ready
to start when he gets here," Ruth returned
casually. She had put on a little blue frock, of
which Nelson was especially fond, for the last
evening, and she was glad to conceal it by a long
coat. Her hand trembled as she pinned her
hat in place. She hoped Nelson Hallowell
wasn't conceited enough to suppose she cared
whether he came at one hour or another.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes past nine when Nelson
arrived, and he looked rather white and shaken.
As he had left for camp two years before, his
mother had stood smiling in the doorway to
watch him go. When it was whispered that
they were going across, and he had told her she
was not likely to see him again till the war was
over, she had kissed him with lips that did not
tremble. But then she had been lifted above
herself by the exalted spirits of the times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Now she had no sense of patriotic service to
sustain her. She realized that she was no
longer a young woman, that life was uncertain,
and that her boy was going very far away.
Over their last meal together she had broken
down, and wept as Nelson had never seen his
mother weep in all his life.</p>

<p>It is not to Nelson's discredit that he had
forgotten Ruth. Or if that is saying too much,
his thought of her was vague and shadowy.
Nelson's father had died when he was a little
boy, and through the years that he was growing
to manhood, his mother and he had been everything
to each other. The sight of her grief was
torturing. He had put his arms about her, and
comforted her as best he could. He had
offered to give up the whole thing, and had
started to go out to telegraph his friend in
Oklahoma that he was not coming. That, more
than anything else, had helped her to regain
her self-control. As mothers have been doing
from time immemorial she wiped her wet eyes
and tried to smile, that he might go on his great
adventure without a shadow on his heart.
Throughout that distressing, solemn, sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
time, it had never occurred to Nelson to look at
the clock. The thought of Ruth had hardly
crossed his mind. Even on his way to her
homo, he was still thinking of the mother he
had left.</p>

<p>It was Graham who, hearing Nelson's step
outside, rushed to admit him. Nelson entered,
blinking a little in the bright light of the room,
and speaking first to one and then another.
Ruth in the corner by the fireplace was talking
to Bob Carey, and was so interested that she
only glanced in Nelson's direction, to toss him
a smiling nod, and then resume her conversation
with Bob. Nelson gave a little start
as if some one had pinched him in the middle
of a dream and he had suddenly awakened.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," remarked Graham cheerfully,
"you haven't left yourself much leeway.
It's just about time to start."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes, I suppose it is." Nelson looked in
Ruth's direction and then looked quickly away.
As for Ruth, she was so absorbed by what Bob
Carey was saying, that her brother had to repeat
his remark for her benefit. "Come, Ruth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Better get a move on. We haven't any time to
waste."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it really time to start?" Ruth asked
carelessly. "I hadn't noticed." And with that
fib on her conscience, she rose and joined the
others.</p>

<p>Fond as Peggy was of Ruth, that evening
she could have shaken her in her exasperation.
For on the walk to the street-car, Ruth clung
to her arm and chattered unceasingly. As
Graham stuck doggedly to Peggy's other side
and Bob was with Amy, Nelson and Priscilla
found themselves walking together. But since
Nelson was too dazed for speech, and Priscilla
was wondering what Horace would say to this
juxtaposition, they walked in an almost unbroken
silence.</p>

<p>It was no better on the street car. Peggy
maneuvered shamelessly to put Nelson and
Ruth into the one vacant seat, but Ruth slipped
past and took her seat beside a fat woman, who
left so little space that Ruth was in imminent
danger of falling into the aisle, whenever the
car turned the corner. In Peggy's opinion such
a catastrophe would have been no more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
she deserved. Peggy had to take the place she
had designed for Ruth, and did her best to be
agreeable, but Nelson's wandering replies
showed the futility of her efforts.</p>

<p>A slight delay on the way brought them to
the station less than ten minutes before train
time. Nelson's tickets were bought, of course,
and his reservations made. They stood in a
group in the station waiting-room and said the
aimless things people generally say five minutes
before train-time. All but Ruth, that is.
When Nelson looked at her he found her attention
absorbed by an Italian family, whose
bundles and babies occupied the nearest row of
seats.</p>

<p>It was Graham who again took on himself
the ungracious duty of calling Nelson's attention
to the flight of time. "I guess you'd better
go aboard, Nelson. You don't want to stand
right here in the station, and miss the train."</p>

<p>Nelson started violently. "Oh, no," he replied,
"certainly not." He turned to Bob
Carey and shook hands with him, murmuring a
mechanical good-by. Amy stood at Bob's side
and Nelson held out his hand to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Amy had shared Peggy's feeling of vexation
with Ruth, and like Peggy had resented her
sense of impotence. Neither one of them would
have hesitated to take Ruth roundly to task for
her conduct, but it was impossible to scold her
in Nelson's presence, and after he had started
on his long journey westward it would be too
late. But as Amy looked into the young fellow's
down-cast face, a brilliant inspiration
came to her aid. She grasped his hand, pulled
herself up on tiptoes, and kissed the astonished
youth squarely on the lips. "Good-by, Nelson,
and good luck."</p>

<p>Peggy, the next in line, saw her friend's ruse,
and seconded her admirably. It was impossible
to tell whether Nelson blushed at the second
kiss, for the flaming color due to Amy's
salute still dyed him crimson. Priscilla pushed
aside the obtrusive thought of Horace, and
backed up the others. And then Nelson came
to Ruth.</p>

<p>For a moment Ruth had been in a quandary.
After their warm friendship, to part with Nelson
with a formal handshake when the other
girls had kissed him, would be to proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
publicly that she was angry, and Ruth did not
wish to seem angry, but only indifferent. And
yet if she kissed Nelson good-by, she had a suspicion
that the barrier her pride had built between
them would melt like mist in the sun.
She raised her eyes and met his, those honest
eyes in which she read bewilderment and grief
and appeal and something greater than all.
And then, all at once, her resentment seemed
incomprehensibly petty. Whatever the reason
that Nelson had come late, it was not because
he did not care. And so their first kiss
was exchanged in the garish light of a railway
waiting-room, with the calls of the trainmen
blending with the unmelodious crying of babies,
with travelers coming and going, and a little
circle of friends standing by and taking everything
in. But there are some experiences it
is impossible to spoil.</p>

<div class="caption">"SHE RAISED HER EYES AND MET HIS"</div>
</div>

<p>"All aboard," cried Graham, and carried
Nelson away. Ruth slipped her arms through
Peggy's, and turned toward the door, swallowing
hard at something that refused to be swallowed.</p>

<p>"If ever a girl deserved a scolding!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Peggy in the tenderest tones imaginable. "But
I'm not going to do it now, because at the last
minute you redeemed yourself&mdash;thanks to
Amy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>PEGGY GIVES A DINNER PARTY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> moped after Nelson's departure. Just
how much her depression was due to missing
him, and how much was the result of self-reproach,
she could not have told. Each time
she realized his absence she remembered with
a pang the hurt wonder of his face that night in
the station. It did not help matters that Nelson
seemed to consider himself entirely to
blame for what had happened, and had written
her from the train a most humble apology for
failing to be at her home at eight o'clock as
he had promised. In fact, his assumption that
she could not possibly be in the wrong only
made Ruth the more conscious of her pettiness.</p>

<p>It was largely on Ruth's account that Peggy
resolved on her dinner party. For after scolding
Ruth soundly, and giving her to understand
that she was very much ashamed of her,
Peggy had set herself resolutely to cheer her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
despondent friend. On the Friday following
Nelson's departure something went wrong with
the heating plant at college, and the classes
were dismissed at ten o'clock. At once Peggy
determined to celebrate.</p>

<p>"Father and mother have gone away for
the week end, and Dick's going home with his
chum after school, and I shan't see him till
bed-time. Come to dinner all of you. We'll
have an old-fashioned good time."</p>

<p>The recipients of this invitation accepted
promptly. They were in the rather hilarious
mood which for some reason characterizes the
most ambitious student when school is dismissed
for the day, college seniors as well as
kindergarten tots. "Only you must let us come
over and help you," stipulated Ruth.</p>

<p>"Yes, come on, and then if anything doesn't
turn out well, I can blame some of you. I
wonder&mdash;do you know, I've half a mind to invite
Hildegarde Carey."</p>

<p>The others approved, especially Priscilla who
had a great admiration for Bob's attractive
sister.</p>

<p>"She took us out that evening, you know,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Peggy continued. "She's always been awfully
sweet to me and I've never done anything for
her. The only thing&mdash;well, I feel a little bit
afraid of her."</p>

<p>"I'll testify that she can eat a very simple
meal and seem to enjoy it." And Amy chuckled
as she always did when she recalled the
first time Hildegarde had sat at her table.</p>

<p>Peggy laughed understandingly. "I think
I'll ask her. I've always thought it was a sort
of snobbishness to be ashamed to give your best
to people who have more than you do. Though
I'm not sure that a party of girls will appeal to
her."</p>

<p>Apparently she had misjudged Hildegarde.
For the latter's tone, when she responded
to Peggy's invitation given over the phone a
few minutes later, was unmistakably enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"A dinner party and just girls! How cute!
I'd adore to come, Peggy, but would it put you
out if I brought my friend Virginia Dunbar?
She's a New York girl who's making me a little
visit and she's perfectly fascinating."</p>

<p>"Why, bring her of course. I shall love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
meet her." Peggy's hospitality rendered her
response sufficiently fervent, but as she hung
up the receiver, her face wore a thoughtful expression.
The little dinner party, which had
seemed pure fun when her three chums were her
prospective guests, had become a responsibility,
as soon as Hildegarde was added to the number.
And with a New York girl coming, it seemed
distinctly formidable.</p>

<p>It had not previously occurred to Peggy that
the house was not in suitable order for the
reception of guests, but now as she looked about
the dining-room its shortcomings were painfully
evident. She donned a long apron and
a sweeping cap, and set resolutely to work.
When the dining room was swept and garnished,
the living room across the hall suffered comparison,
and Peggy gave that equally careful
attention. And as by this time she was on
her mettle, she went to work cleaning the silver.
The twelve o'clock whistles surprised her in
this exacting task, and she swallowed a peanut-butter
sandwich by way of luncheon, promising
herself to make up for this abstemiousness at
dinner, Peggy was not one of the temperamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
cooks who cannot enjoy their own cooking.</p>

<p>At half past one she hurried forth with her
market basket to make the necessary purchases.
She left by the back door and took
the key with her. A little after two she was
back again, the loaded basket on her arm.
Peggy set her burden down, rubbed her aching
muscles, and felt in her coat pocket for the
key. Then she felt in the other pocket. Then
she continued to search one pocket and then
the other, with increasing evidences of consternation.
But it was of no use. The key
was gone.</p>

<p>"I must have had it in my hand and laid it
down on the counter somewhere," thought
Peggy. "Was ever anything so exasperating."
She left the basket outside the locked door,
and hurriedly retraced her steps. The butcher,
whom she had visited first, shook his head in
answer to her question. No, he had not seen
a stray door-key. It was the same at the grocer's,
the same at the bakery where she had
bought Parker-house rolls. Peggy walked home
over the route she had traversed, her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
glued to the side-walk, but she did not find the
key.</p>

<p>Ruth was waiting for her by the front steps.
"I thought I'd come over and help you. I hope
you haven't finished everything."</p>

<p>"I haven't even started," replied Peggy in a
hollow voice, and explained the situation. Ruth
was a girl of resources and at once she had a
bright idea.</p>

<p>"Peggy, our front door key looks a good bit
like yours. Perhaps it will open the door.
I'll run over and get it."</p>

<p>"Then, fly," pleaded Peggy, "It's simply awful
to be locked out of your house when you have
a million things to do."</p>

<p>Ruth sped on her errand at a pace which
satisfied even the impatient Peggy, and returned
with a key which really did look like
the latch key with whose appearance Peggy was
most familiar. Hopefully she inserted it in
the appropriate key-hole. Patiently she turned
it this way and that. The latch key was like
a great many people, encouraging one's expectations
by almost doing what it was asked
to do, but never quite succeeding. In the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Peggy mournfully relinquished all hope of entering
the house by its aid.</p>

<p>"I can't waste any more time on that key.
It won't work, and I've got to get in."</p>

<p>"How about the windows," suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>"The windows on the first floor are all locked,
for I made sure of that before I started out."</p>

<p>"If we could borrow a ladder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know anybody who owns a ladder.
No, there's just one chance as far as I can
see. I've always wondered if I could get in
through the coal shute and now I'm going to
see."</p>

<p>"But, Peggy, it's so dirty."</p>

<p>"I know, but it's got to be done."</p>

<p>"You might get stuck," exclaimed Ruth, turning
pale. "Wait a little, Peggy. Perhaps
something will happen."</p>

<p>"Unless an air ship comes along and takes
me to a second story window, I can't think of
anything that could happen that would be of
any help to me."</p>

<p>The narrow, inclined passage through which
the coal was chuted from the side walk to the
cellar bin, looked small enough and black enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to justify Ruth's forebodings. But Peggy's impatience
had reached the point where anything
seemed better than inaction. She lowered herself
into the chute, and when she released her
hold of the edge, her descent was so rapid that
Ruth shrieked. But after a moment of suspense
she heard an encouraging rattle of coal,
and then steps slowly ascending the cellar steps.
A little later the front door was shaken violently
without opening, however, and Peggy's
face presently appeared at one of the living-room
windows. Regardless of the fact that
her friend was attempting to tell her something,
Ruth screamed with laughter, for Peggy's face
was so begrimed as to suggest that her habitual
occupation was that of a chimney-sweep. Ruth's
laughter was short-lived, however, for raising
her voice, Peggy made herself heard, and with
an accent of authority by no means characteristic.</p>

<p>"Stop laughing, Ruth, and help me. In fooling
with your key I've done something to that
wretched lock, and now I can't open the door
even from the inside."</p>

<p>"The front door?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't open either door," cried Peggy. "I
can't open <i>any</i> door. The only way to get into
the house is by the window, and Hildegarde
Carey is coming to dinner and a girl from New
York."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, Peggy?" Ruth
was so carried away by her friend's excitement
that for the moment she was unable to see anything
humorous in the situation.</p>

<p>"Bring me my market basket, first. It's on
the back steps. And then find a locksmith and
bring him here. Don't be satisfied with having
him say he'll come. Bring him with you."</p>

<p>Ruth hurried to the back of the house, secured
the heavy basket, and returned with it
to the living room window. And then she astonished
Peggy by setting the basket down and
beginning to laugh hysterically.</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy, please excuse me. I really didn't
mean to laugh, but honestly you're the funniest
sight I've ever seen. You're striped just
like a zebra."</p>

<p>Curiosity led Peggy to consult the mirror
over the mantel. But instead of laughing as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Ruth had done, she uttered a tragic groan.</p>

<p>"It's going to take a terrible time to clean
that off, if it ever does come off. Oh, Ruth,
hurry! When I think of all that will have to
be done before six o'clock, my head just whirls."</p>

<p>Ruth took a hasty departure and Peggy, having
carried the basket to the kitchen, rushed
upstairs to remove all traces of her recent novel
entry. As this necessitated an entire change
of clothing and the use of a prodigious amount
of soap and hot water, her toilet consumed more
time than she could well spare. But at length,
clean and extremely pink, and attired in a little
frock not too good for getting dinner and yet
good enough to pass muster at the table, she
rushed downstairs and attacked her vegetables.
And still no sign of Ruth, bringing the locksmith.</p>

<p>About five o'clock Priscilla arrived ready to
lend a hand. Peggy answered her ring at the
window, instead of at the door, and after a
brief conversation, the tall Priscilla made an
unconventional entry. Amy arriving twenty
minutes later was admitted by the same entrance.
The girls made themselves useful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
speculated on what was detaining Ruth.</p>

<p>"I don't mind letting you girls in through
the window," groaned Peggy. "But it's different
with Hildegarde. And that New York
girl. Oh, heavens!"</p>

<p>At five o'clock they were all too nervous to
know what they were doing. Peggy set skillets
on the stove with nothing in them, and snatched
them off again, just in time to avert disaster.
She salted vegetables and then forgot and salted
them all over again. Priscilla was trying to set
the table, and making a poor job of it, as is
generally the case when one is doing one thing
and thinking of another. Amy, after going to
the front window on the average of once in
every two minutes to see if Ruth were coming,
felt that she could bear inaction no longer.</p>

<p>"Peggy, where's the latch key to your front
door?"</p>

<p>"Hanging on a hook over by the umbrellas.
But you can't do anything with it. I've tried."</p>

<p>"What a key has done a key can undo," replied
Amy, sententiously; and possessing herself
of the magic piece of steel, she climbed out
of the window and set to work. For fifteen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
twenty minutes she continued to fumble at the
lock without results, and she was on the point
of deciding that she might be putting in the time
to better advantage, when something clicked
encouragingly. Amy turned the knob, and
squealed with delight; for the door opened.</p>

<p>Before she could proclaim her success, Priscilla
had made a discovery. Lying across a
chair in the kitchen was a garment of some
indeterminate shade between blue and black.
"What's this?" asked Priscilla, pausing to
examine it.</p>

<p>"It's my old blue coat. But since I came
down the coal chute, I don't know as I can ever
wear it again. It isn't worth sending to the
cleaner's, and I'm afraid it's beyond my skill."</p>

<p>"I'll hang it in the laundry," said Priscilla,
and lifted the smutty garment daintily by the
tips of her fingers. The coat swung against
the round of the chair with a distinct clink,
and Peggy looked up quickly. "What was
that?"</p>

<p>"A button, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"The buttons are cloth. And that was such
a queer sound&mdash;like metal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Priscilla had a brilliant idea. Disregarding
the fact that the coal dust with which the garment
was covered came off on her hands, she
began eagerly feeling along the lower edge.
And just as Amy heard the click that meant
victory, Priscilla uttered an ecstatic cry.</p>

<p>"The key, Peggy! I've found your key!"</p>

<p>"What? Where? Oh, Priscilla, not really?"</p>

<p>"There must have been a hole in your
pocket," declared Priscilla. "The key slipped
down between the outside and the lining. You
can feel for yourself. There's a key all right,
and it's not likely it's a different one."</p>

<p>"Take a knife and rip up the lining at the
bottom," ordered Peggy recklessly. "Yes, of
course it's the key. I wonder if I'd rather have
that New York girl come in by the back door
or the front window."</p>

<p>That query had hardly left her lips, when
Amy rushed in. "I've done it, Peggy, I've
done it."</p>

<p>"You don't mean you've got the door open?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. I was just ready to give up
and then I tried again and something clicked
and the deed was done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Priscilla's found the back-door key.
Now Ruth will come with the locksmith."</p>

<p>They heard footsteps even as she spoke, and
then Ruth's voice explaining to the locksmith
that the only way to get into the house was by
the window. Peggy went to meet them, assuming
a very dignified air that she might not look
sheepish.</p>

<p>"We succeeded in opening the doors that
were troubling us, but there's a key broken off
in a lock upstairs. Since you're here, you
might as well attend to that. Will you take him
upstairs Ruth? It's the door of the den." And
then Peggy beat a retreat to the kitchen, leaving
Ruth to propitiate the locksmith, who had
left his shop reluctantly, yielding to her impassioned
representations of the urgency of the
case.</p>

<p>Dinner was more than half an hour late, and
failed to justify Peggy's reputation as a cook,
for some dishes were over-salted and others
entirely lacking that essential ingredient, while
the pudding was so overdone that it was necessary
to remove the top layer, and conceal deficiencies
by a quite superfluous meringue. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
since Peggy had planned her dinner party with
the purpose of distracting Ruth's thoughts,
she had every reason to consider it an unqualified
success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>AT THE FOOT-BALL GAME</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> foot-ball season was on. It had opened
auspiciously when the university had crushingly
defeated the visitors, and the attendance
upon the second game showed that the public
anticipated a similar victory. Priscilla, sitting
demurely beside Horace Hitchcock, was a-tingle
with excitement. Not for the world would
she have allowed Horace to guess how momentous
the occasion seemed.</p>

<p>The tiers of seats gave a dazzling effect of
color. Pennants and flags and the bright-colored
hats of the girls made Priscilla think
of terraces covered with flowers. Every one
was talking, almost drowning out the noisy efforts
of the 'varsity band. It seemed to Priscilla
an unfitting time to quote Schopenhauer,
but the Schopenhauer pose was Horace's latest,
and it recognized neither time nor seasons.</p>

<p>Priscilla leaned impulsively across Horace to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
wave to Amy, whose good-humored face had
suddenly differentiated itself from the mass of
surrounding faces. Horace interrupted in the
midst of a peculiarly pessimistic utterance,
looked frankly vexed, and Priscilla apologized.
"Excuse me, I just happened to see Amy."</p>

<p>"It is not a surprise to me, Priscilla, to find
you uninterested. It is the fate of some souls
to be solitary. Once I had hoped&mdash;but it
doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Priscilla's mood was a little perverse.
"Perhaps the reason you're solitary is that you
choose such unpleasant paths. If you'd only
walk where it was nice and sunny, you'd have
plenty of company."</p>

<p>"Plenty of company! Heavens!" Horace
shuddered. "That suggests the crowd. It is
bad enough for the body to be jostled, but at
least the spirit can command unhampered
space. I had dreamed once that you might
follow me to the heights where the atmosphere
is too rare for the multitude, but&mdash;Why do we
cling to life, when each hour that passes
shatters another illusion?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Horace," Priscilla bit her lip. She was young
and eager. She wanted passionately to be
happy. She longed to respond to the charm of
the hour, to enjoy it ardently, and instead she
was obliged to listen to quotations from Schopenhauer,
and think of Horace's lost illusions.
The thought crossed her mind that since she
could not make Horace happy even for an afternoon,
and since he was certainly not making her
so, it promised ill for the future. If only
Horace could be brought to see that they had
made a mistake. A little flutter of hope stirred
in Priscilla's heart.</p>

<p>Horace was speaking in a tone of extreme
bitterness. "Blessed is the man who expects
nothing from life, for he shall not be disappointed."</p>

<p>"Horace," began Priscilla firmly. "Don't
you think that we&mdash;I mean wouldn't it be
better&mdash;"</p>

<p>A number of people were coming into the
vacant places on her left. A young man seated
himself beside Priscilla, and involuntarily she
turned. Then she gave an impulsive start and
her ready color flamed up. The young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
who wore glasses, also started and after an
almost imperceptible hesitation lifted his hat.
Simultaneously Priscilla bowed in the most unresponsive
fashion possible, and looked away.</p>

<p>Horace stared suspiciously at her flushed
cheeks. Horace had never heard the story of
the supper at the Green Parrot, and the fragment
of roll that had sought to drown itself in
the stranger's coffee-cup. If Priscilla had ever
taken him into her confidence, he might have
guessed the explanation of her present
embarrassment. As it was, he leaned close and
said in her ear, "Who is that fellow?"</p>

<p>"Sh! I'll tell you afterward."</p>

<p>Poor Priscilla! The game to which she had
looked forward had become an impossible nightmare.
Horace's philosophical pursuits had
not freed him from that ready jealousy which
is the characteristic of small natures. He sat
glowering across Priscilla's shoulder at the
young man seated on her left. As it was impossible
to misunderstand Horace's expression,
the young man, after his first recognition
of Priscilla's presence, obligingly ignored her.</p>

<p>The finishing of the first half was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
enormous relief to Priscilla. The majority of
the seats in the grand-stand were immediately
vacated. The flower bed had become kaleidoscopic,
with the bits of color continually rearranging
themselves, as laughing girls and
glowing youths moved about, excitedly discussing
the points of the game they had witnessed.
But though Priscilla was so ardent a fan, she
knew little of the game and cared less.</p>

<p>The young man at her left had been one of
the first to rise. As he moved away, Priscilla
turned to Horace, and without giving herself
time to be frightened by his forbidding expression,
she told him the story of her first and only
visit to the Green Parrot.</p>

<p>After she had finished, Horace seemed to be
waiting for more. "Do you mean that is all?"
he demanded at length.</p>

<p>"All? Of course it's all."</p>

<p>"Then why did you blush that way?"</p>

<p>The red went out of Priscilla's cheeks.
Even the color due to the frostiness of the outdoor
air was replaced by an angry pallor.
"Do you mean," she said in a level voice,
"that you don't believe me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fellow crowds in and sits down beside
you, a fellow I've never seen. You recognize
each other and then you turn crimson. You
refuse to give me any explanation till enough
time has elapsed for fabricating a story,
plausible from your point of view&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horace!"</p>

<p>"And you then tell me a yarn that is no explanation
whatever. What if a piece of roll
did fly out of your hand and fall into somebody's
coffee cup! What is there in that to
turn you all colors of the rainbow? You're
stringing me, that's all." The Horace who
quoted Schopenhauer, and talked like the hero
of a society novel, had magically disappeared,
and in his place was a slangy young man, very
much like other young men in a bad temper.</p>

<p>"Horace," said Priscilla, her lips trembling,
"I've been afraid for a long time that we'd
made a mistake. I can't seem to please you,
no matter how hard I try, and probably it won't
surprise you to know that I've been perfectly
miserable for the last six months. And it
seems to me the best thing we can do&mdash;"</p>

<p>The people were beginning to come back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
their seats. A couple just in front of Horace
and Priscilla turned to scream something to a
row of young people back of them. Priscilla
tightened her grip on her self control and
looked straight ahead. It was not the time
nor place for breaking an engagement. She
must wait till she could get away from this
noisy, laughing crowd. Oh, if only the dreadful
afternoon were over.</p>

<p>The university triumphed again, as its
friends had anticipated. There was the usual
tumultuous cheering, the usual frantic demonstrations.
Priscilla gave Horace the benefit of
a frigid profile. Her sense of indignity kept
her sternly silent. He had accused her of
lying, and that meant all was over between
them. Underneath her hurt and humiliation
was a sense of relief she refused to acknowledge
even to herself. Fortunately the young man in
eye-glasses did not return to take the vacant
place at Priscilla's left, and the situation was
not further complicated by his embarrassing
presence.</p>

<p>She stood up as the crowd rose, thankful for
the prospect of escape. Horace put his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
lightly on her arm. "Wouldn't you like something
hot to drink?" he asked. "Chocolate or
coffee?" His tone was caressing.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything except to get home."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go home, little girl. I only
thought you might be chilled sitting here in the
cold so long."</p>

<p>He spoke with placid tenderness, as if their
quarrel belonged to the Babylonian era of
their acquaintance. Priscilla cast a frightened
glance at him. She felt like a fly, partially disentangling
itself from the spider's web, only
to find itself again mysteriously ensnared.
"Don't, Horace," she exclaimed impulsively.</p>

<p>"Don't what, Priscilla?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk as if nothing had happened. If
you believe that I'm a liar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, don't be absurd. We'd better
not talk till you're calmer."</p>

<p>"I'm as calm as I'm likely to be when I'm
talking of this, Horace. If you think it a little
thing to doubt my word, I don't agree with
you."</p>

<p>He took her arm and bent down till his face
was very close to hers. "Can't you make allowances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Priscilla, for a man crazed with love
and jealousy?"</p>

<p>"You haven't any right&mdash;" Her voice broke
in a sob. She fought desperately against the
tears that placed her, she vaguely realized, at
such a serious disadvantage, but they were too
much for her. They splashed down on her
white cheeks, and the couples crowding past
glanced at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Priscilla. I accept your explanation.
I ask your forgiveness. I am at
your feet."</p>

<p>She was lost and she knew it, but she
struggled nevertheless. "We've made a mistake.
We're not happy, either of us. It's
better to stop now than later."</p>

<p>"Priscilla&mdash;are you in love with him?"</p>

<p>Horace's tone had changed magically. It
was no longer tenderly matter-of-fact, but
tragic, desperate. She stared at him aghast.
"In love&mdash;why, what, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"With that man who sat beside you to-day,
the man who did not dare come back and face
me."</p>

<p>"Horace,&mdash;why, Horace, you must be crazy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I told you I had never seen him but once before,
and I told you what happened then."</p>

<p>Her disclaimer did not afford him any
especial relief. He was muttering to himself.
She caught the words, "As well now as later,"
and fear gripped her heart. He did not
directly address her till they had left the field
behind, and were no longer surrounded by the
laughing, buoyant throng.</p>

<p>"I have foreseen this, Priscilla. I have
known that happiness was not for me. But I
have tried to shut my eyes to the truth, to hope
for the impossible. Now you have thrown me
away like a ripped glove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horace, I didn't." Even at this tragic
moment the thought crossed Priscilla's mind
that instead of throwing away a ripped glove as
worthless, she would sit down conscientiously
to mend it. She brushed aside the reflection
as unworthy the occasion and hurried on, "It
isn't that. But if we can't be happy now, if
we're always irritating and hurting each
other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't need to say more, Priscilla.
You are weary of me. I had dreamed I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
found a soul capable of constancy&mdash;but no
matter. This is good-by, Priscilla. I cannot
live without you. When you take away your
love from me, you take away all that makes life
endurable. All I ask now is forgetfulness, and
only death can promise me that&mdash;Good-by,
Priscilla."</p>

<p>Poor Priscilla! She should have known
better. Long before she had discovered
Horace's weakness for posing. It was no
secret to her that he experienced the keenest
satisfaction in contemplating the ravages
wrought in his nature by successive disillusionments.
Yet though she understood, at this crisis
her good sense failed her. In spite of herself,
she interpreted Horace's speech by her own
sincerity, and a chill terror took possession of
her. He would kill himself and she would be to
blame. Although the law would not recognize
her crime, at the bar of her own conscience she
would be adjudged guilty of murder.</p>

<p>"Horace," she wailed, "you did not understand
me. I want to make you happy, that's
all. If you think we haven't made a mistake,
I'm satisfied."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>It took a long time to reassure Horace. It
was so hard to explain matters satisfactorily
that it almost seemed as if he were stupid or
else wilfully perverse. Much of the time he
stared blankly ahead, so lost in gloomy reflections
that she had to speak his name twice, before
she could attract his attention. His lips
moved, too, but without a sound, as if he were
saying things too dreadful to be heard. Altogether
Priscilla suffered intolerably before
she could bring the unhappy young man to reconsider
his desperate purpose.</p>

<p>At last she was partially successful. He became
calm enough to listen to her repeated
assurances that all she thought of was his
happiness and, though his mood was still sober
when they parted, he had given a half-hearted
and reluctant promise that he would surrender,
for the present at least, all thought of doing
away with the life he valued so lightly.</p>

<p>Priscilla was not sure how she got through
the rest of the day. Her mother noticed her
abstraction and speculated hopefully as to
whether she had quarreled with Horace.
While Priscilla's parents had never been let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
into the secret of the engagement, they could
not be unaware of the significance of Horace's
attentions. Like most American fathers and
mothers, they believed a girl should be allowed
to choose her own friends, unless there was
some decided reason to oppose her choice. Although
neither of them liked Horace, the
reasons for their prejudice were too vague
and too personal to constitute a ground for
opposing the intimacy. Moreover, both of
Priscilla's parents were of the opinion that if
she saw enough of the young man she would tire
of the mannerisms they found so objectionable.</p>

<p>It was not till Priscilla was safe in bed that
she dared relieve her over-burdened heart by
tears. And as she lay sobbing with the coverlet
over her head, she solemnly relinquished all
hope of happiness in this world.</p>

<p>"It was my vanity that got me into this,"
lamented Priscilla. "I didn't like to feel I was
less attractive than the other girls and so I
fairly snatched at Horace. Now I've got to
stand by my promise if it kills me, but Oh, how
am I going to bear it!"</p>

<p>So Priscilla cried herself to sleep. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
there was an added poignancy in her grief as
she remembered that the Combs family was
notably long-lived, boasting some distant
ancestors who had rounded out a full century
of existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>THE CURE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were out for a walk one Saturday
evening, Peggy and Amy, with Graham and
Bob in attendance, when in front of a little
movie theater, Peggy stopped short. A young
couple stood at the ticket booth, the girl
giggling vacuously as the very slender youth
fumbled in his pockets for the price of
admission. Peggy's abrupt halt was not due
to the charm of the flaring poster, representing
a fat woman with a broom in pursuit of a thin
man attired in a bath-robe. Her attention was
absorbed by the young couple, who were planning
to enjoy the show. For while she had
never seen the girl before, the slender youth
was her younger brother, Dick.</p>

<p>As the two disappeared behind the swinging
doors, Peggy turned to her companions.
"Think you could stand it?" She indicated
the poster by a gesture, and Bob Carey, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
did not have the pleasure of Dick's acquaintance,
looked surprised, while Graham's face
wore an expression of doubt.</p>

<p>"I've seen just as bad, Peggy, and still survive,"
Graham said. "But I hardly think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course we can stand it, if you'd like to
go in, Peggy," interrupted Amy. And Bob,
though evidently puzzled by Peggy's taste
moved quickly forward to purchase the tickets,
thus getting ahead of Graham who was still
inclined to remonstrate. Graham understood
that Peggy was not especially pleased to discover
Dick in company with a girl she knew
nothing about, especially since her manner had
made anything but a favorable impression in
the few seconds she had been under observation.
But Dick, while considerably short of
his majority, was old enough to resent interference
in his affairs, and Graham could not see
that Peggy would gain anything by trying to
play detective.</p>

<p>The film which constituted the evening's
entertainment was exceptionally poor. The
comedy was of the atrocious, slap-stick sort
that moves the judicious almost to tears while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the feature play, a melodrama only saved from
being a tragedy by an inconsistently happy
ending, was frequently so overdone as to be extremely
funny. Peggy paid comparatively
little attention to the drama as it unrolled before
her eyes. First of all she set herself to
locate Dick and his companion, and then to
evolve a plan of action suited to the requirements
of the case.</p>

<p>Graham spoke confidentially in her ear.
"Don't worry, Peggy. Every boy has his silly
times. I did myself." Graham's manner suggested
that he was speaking from the vantage-point
of discreet middle age.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." Peggy did not mean her
answer just as it sounded. She was simply
thinking of something else. Graham stared at
the inane chase, unfolding on the screen, where
a procession of people ran into everything
imaginable from a peanut vendor's cart to an
express train, and presently tried again.
"You want to be careful, Peggy. He's just at
the age to resent your trying to manage him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," whispered Peggy again.
She was fully as alive as Graham to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
necessity of tact. But she was aware, too, that
all boys do not pass through the silly stage as
unscathed as Graham had done. All the loyal
sister in her was alert.</p>

<p>They sat through the depressing comedy and
the amusing tragedy, and then suddenly Peggy
rose. She had seen Dick on ahead getting to
his feet. In the darkness of the picture house
there was no danger he would recognize her.
Indeed it was unlikely that he would have seen
her even if the lights had been turned on, so
engrossed was he by the plump little person
whose head barely reached his shoulder.</p>

<p>Peggy and her party were outside first. All
unaware of the ambush, Dick came blundering
on. He was talking fast and the girl was
giggling approval. Peggy saw that she was
all she had feared. Her round cheeks were
rouged so as to give an excellent imitation of a
pair of Baldwin apples. Between the crimson
circles her nose gleamed ludicrously white, suggesting
a very recent use of her powder puff.
Her bobbed hair, together with her diminutive
frame, gave her a childish air, contradicted by
the shrewdness of her eyes. Peggy guessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that Dick's friend was considerably his senior,
probably not far from her own age.</p>

<p>Dick was laughing rather boisterously at one
of his own witticisms, when Peggy touched his
arm. "Hello, Dick!" Her tone was nonchalant,
but Dick started, straightened himself
and flushed angrily. All his masculine pride
was up in arms at the thought of coercion. But
Peggy's matter-of-fact air partly allayed his
suspicions.</p>

<p>"We sat about six rows back of you," she
explained. "Dick, you haven't met Mr. Carey,
have you? My brother, Richard, Bob."</p>

<p>The two shook hands and Dick realized that
reciprocity was in order. Under the most
favorable circumstances, performing the ceremony
of introduction was to Dick an agonizing
ordeal, and the present situation increased his
inevitable embarrassment a hundred fold. He
was the color of a ripe tomato as he blurted
out, "Miss Coffin, let me introduce you to my
sister&mdash;Miss Raymond&mdash;and Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;"
He had forgotten Amy's name after having
known it all his life, and Peggy came to the
rescue, and introduced the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever Dick's feeling in regard to the
meeting, it was clear that Miss Coffin was not
displeased. She fixed a hypnotic gaze on Bob
Carey as she exclaimed, "Fierce name, isn't it!
But take it from me, I'm no dead one, Coffin or
no coffin."</p>

<p>Peggy's smile gave no hint of her inward
anguish. "We're just going home to have
some oysters. Won't you and Dick come
along, Miss Coffin?"</p>

<p>Graham had difficulty in choking down an
impatient exclamation. What was Peggy
thinking of? It was bad enough for Dick to be
associating with a girl of this sort, but for
Peggy to encourage him in his folly by
welcoming the girl to her home, the first time
she had ever seen her, impressively illustrated
the feminine incapacity to act reasonably in a
crisis. While it was impossible to put his disapproval
into words, Graham's manner left
little unexpressed.</p>

<p>Dick looked as if he agreed with Graham, but
Peggy had not addressed herself to him. And
as for Miss Coffin, Peggy's invitation was responsible
for a marked increase in her sprightliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
"Eats!" she cried dramatically, "Oh,
boy! Lead me to it!"</p>

<p>They went down the street in the direction of
Friendly Terrace, Miss Coffin chattering
animatedly at Dick's elbow, and speaking
loudly enough to be heard easily by the others.
Indeed, there was ground for supposing that
she was willing to allow her vivacious conversation
to make an impression on more important
listeners than Dick. Her youthful escort,
stalking awkwardly at her side, was almost as
silent as Graham who walked on ahead with
Peggy. But the silence of her brother and her
lover, even though it implied criticism and displeasure,
seemingly failed to shadow Peggy's
spirits. She turned her head every now and
then to address a remark to Dick's companion,
and Miss Coffin showed her appreciation of the
friendly attitude by the request that she "cut
out the formal stuff." "You kids are the kind
that can call me Mazie," she chirruped, apparently
under the impression that she was addressing
some one at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well for the success of
Peggy's plan that neither her father nor her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
mother were at home. She ushered her guests
into the living room and insisted on their laying
aside their wraps. Mazie Coffin having removed
her hat, went straight as a homing
pigeon to the mirror over the mantel, and made
an unabashed and quite unnecessary use of
her powder puff.</p>

<p>"You're coming out to help me, aren't you,
Amy?" Peggy inquired casually. "I thought
I'd fix little pigs-in-blankets, you know.
They're awfully good, but rather fussy."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'll help," responded Amy,
wondering if Mazie, also, would be called on to
render assistance. But apparently Peggy's
acquaintance with Mazie had not progressed to
that point of informality. "We'll try not to
be any longer than we can help," she smiled,
"and we'll leave you to amuse one another till
we're ready."</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen as they wrapped fat
oysters in blankets of bacon, pinning the latter
in place with wooden tooth-picks, the two girls
exchanged significant glances. "What's the
idea?" Amy asked, with the frankness of
long friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure that it will do any good.
But I've got an idea&mdash;Don't you know that
the impression a thing makes on you depends a
lot on the background?"</p>

<p>"Hm! I don't quite understand what you
mean."</p>

<p>"Well, if you see a girl on the stage with a
skirt nine inches long, it doesn't make the same
impression on you that it would if you saw her
in your own home."</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't."</p>

<p>"Dick's been used to nice people all his life,"
Peggy went on, plainly trying to encourage
herself as well as to explain matters to Amy.
"A girl like this might attract his attention if
he saw her behind the counter of a cigar
store&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does she work in a cigar store?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea. I only meant she
wouldn't seem particularly out of place in a
tobacco shop. But here in our home&mdash;Oh, it
seems as though Dick must see how cheap and
tawdry she is."</p>

<p>Amy skewered a particularly juicy oyster
with a vicious thrust of the tooth pick. "Hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
so, anyway," she said, and felt an exasperated
desire to box Dick's ears.</p>

<p>But when Peggy had left the field to Mazie
Coffin, she had builded better than she knew,
Mazie had accepted the responsibility of entertaining
the masculine portion of the company
with extreme complacency. Never for a
moment had she doubted her ability to make
a favorable impression. As she gave her
smiling attention to the trio, her late escort occupied
a very small fraction of her thoughts.
Dick was only a boy, a boy to whom shaving
was still a novel art, and whose voice cracked
ludicrously in moments of excitement. But
Graham and Bob were young men, and good
looking young men at that. Mazie hoped that
the girls would not hurry with the oysters.</p>

<p>As this young woman's methods were not
characterized by subtlety, it was not long before
Dick realized that he was being disregarded.
Mazie had eyes only for his seniors.
She had begun by saying, as the door closed
behind Peggy and Amy, "Gee, but they're
trusting! How do they know that I won't
vamp you two guys!" And when Dick, resenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
his new rôle of unnoticed on-looker, had
attempted to bear his part in the conversation,
Mazie had silenced him with a jocose, "What
are you butting in for, kid? Children must be
seen and not heard, you know."</p>

<p>Dick Raymond was by no means a bad boy,
and he was just as far from being a stupid boy.
Mazie's conversational advances, as she had
weighed out peanut brittle and caramels in
quarter pound lots, had flattered his vanity.
Dick was not accustomed to being regarded as
a young man, and Mazie's manner of considering
him worth-while game had naturally convinced
him that she was a girl of exceptional insight.
But now as she made eyes at Graham
and smiled at Bob, the conviction seized Dick
that her previous attentions had been due to
the fact that he was the only one of his kind
within reach. As was natural, the discovery
made him critical. He noticed the harshness
of Mazie's voice, the vacuity of her giggle.
Her repetition of cheap slang began to jar on
him, even though he was himself a similar
offender. He looked distrustfully at the crimson
cheeks, with the powdered nose gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
whitely between. "I'll be 'jiggered if it doesn't
look exactly like a marshmallow," he told himself.</p>

<p>The possibility that Dick's mood was critical
did not trouble Mazie. She had looked Peggy
and Amy over with the complacent certainty of
her superior charms. Dick's sister wasn't a bad
looker, Mazie owned condescendingly, but she
was slow, dead slow, and nowadays the fellows
liked plenty of pep. Mazie prided herself, not
without reason, on having an abundance of that
essential quality. She was sorry when the fragrance
of frying bacon and coffee greeted her
nostrils. Though Graham was stiffly polite and
Bob Carey plainly amused, she would have been
glad of a little more time.</p>

<p>The impromptu supper in the dining-room
completed Dick's disillusionment. Determined
not to yield any advantage she had gained
Mazie continued to take the lead in the conversation.
She gestured freely and frequently
with the hand which held her fork, even with an
oyster impaled on the tines. She drank her coffee
noisily. Once, Dick was sure, he saw Bob
choke down a laugh, though he made a pretence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of coughing behind his napkin. And it was not,
Dick was certain, because he found her amusing,
but because he thought her ridiculous.
Dick glared furiously at the averted shoulder
of his erst-while charmer. Mazie had elected
to treat him like a little boy, but if she had listened
to him, thought Dick, he could have kept
her from making a fool of herself.</p>

<p>Mazie seemed willing to linger, even after
Amy and Bob had taken their departure.
"Guess we might as well be starting," suggested
Dick, his thoughts upon the probable return
of his father and mother, rather than on
his responsibility as host.</p>

<p>"Getting sleepy aren't you, little boy?"
mocked Mazie. "Don't let me keep you from
your downy. I can get home somehow," and
she glanced significantly at Graham, whose good
looks, for all his air of reserve, had made a
strong impression on her susceptible temperament.</p>

<p>When at length she left under the escort of
a frankly sulky Dick, she turned back to remind
Graham that he could always find her in
Streeter's Sweet Shop between the hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
nine and five. And then she took Dick's arm,
and went out the door, smiling back coquettishly
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Graham hardly waited for them to be out of
hearing before he exploded. The evening had
been a great disappointment, and while Graham
would have resented any outside suggestion
that Peggy came short of absolute perfection,
there were times when he felt himself quite
capable of pointing out her errors in judgment.
Peggy's painstaking explanation failed to enlighten
him, and while Peggy thought Graham
the most wonderful of men, in this instance she
found him disappointingly slow of comprehension.
They did not quarrel, but they kept on
arguing the question long after it was clear that
neither would be able to take the other's
point of view. They were still arguing when
Dick returned.</p>

<p>Dick was in that state of irritation when
scolding somebody seems an indispensable luxury.
"See here, Peggy, just because you see
me with a girl, you don't have to start right in
and invite her to the house."</p>

<p>"Why, Dick, I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sometimes a fellow asks a girl out just so
he can size her up. And if he finds that she's
a blamed idiot, he don't want her mixed up
with his family. You mean all right, Peggy,
but you don't understand life the way Graham
and I do. I don't want you to have anything
more to do with Mazie Coffin, Peggy. She's
not the sort of girl for you to associate with.
You can ask Graham about it if you don't believe
me."</p>

<p>And as Dick stalked off to bed, ill tempered
and aggrieved and abnormally dignified, even
Graham was obliged to admit that it looked
like a cure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>DELIVERANCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla</span> had seen Horace only once since
the football game, and then for a short and unsatisfactory
interview. Immediately after,
Horace had left town for one of those trips
which so cleverly combined business and
pleasure, a combination of which Horace
seemed to have the secret. A long letter
which might have been an excerpt from the
Journal of Another Disappointed Man gave
her no address to which to write him, and the
best she could do was to promise herself to be
very, very kind to Horace on his return. She
owed him that for the wrong she had done him.</p>

<p>The days went by without any further word
from Horace, and Friday rounded out a full
week since she had last seen him. Priscilla and
Peggy walked home from class together with
that sense of leisure Friday afternoon brings
to each student, no matter how much must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
done before Monday morning. They paused
at Peggy's door and Peggy urged hospitably,
"Come on in."</p>

<p>"I think I'd better go home and see if
mother's there, and if she wants anything. We
haven't seen our maid for three days."</p>

<p>"Well, we've <i>seen</i> Sally, if that's any comfort,"
laughed Peggy. "But she's been about
as much good as if she'd been at the North Pole.
A woman she knows was knocked down by an
automobile and taken to the hospital, and all
Sally has been good for since is to dramatize the
affair. First she's the automobile speeding
recklessly on, and then she's the poor victim.
You never saw anything so realistic as the way
she drops on the kitchen floor."</p>

<p>Priscilla laughed, but disapprovingly. "I
don't see how you folks put up with her, Peggy.
She'd drive me crazy."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no denying she's a trial at
times, but Sally has her good points. She's
devoted to us all, for one thing, and that isn't
very common these days. And besides," added
Peggy simply, "if we didn't keep her I don't
know how the poor thing would get along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The two girls had been together all day but
they lingered, loath to separate. "Listen,
Peggy," Priscilla exclaimed. "Come home
with me. Like enough mother will have an
errand for me to do and then we can go together.
Don't you love outdoors when it's still
and cold like this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, love it. I'll go and see if we need anything
in the way of groceries, and I'll join you
in about a minute."</p>

<p>Peggy hurried up the walk and Priscilla
went on her way. The evening paper lay folded
on the porch of her home and she picked it up
and tucked it under her arm before she slipped
her key into the latch. She found the kitchen
empty and ran upstairs, calling her mother.
But only the echoes answered, and Priscilla
realized that except for herself the house was
empty.</p>

<p>Priscilla seated herself to wait for Peggy,
picking up the paper she had thrown on the
library table. Her eye ran mechanically over
the columns. She turned the sheets, her
thoughts still busy with the day's happenings,
and with vague plans for the morrow. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
unexpectedly a familiar face flashed out at her
from the page, set above head-lines that seemed
fairly to shriek their news.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Young Hitchcock Surprises Friends<br />
Society Man Marries in New York</span><br />
</div>

<p>Priscilla, sitting motionless, read the news
over several times. Then her eyes began moving
down the column. Even when she saw
Horace's name written out in full, her sense
of unreality persisted. The reporter had
treated the matter humorously, following the
precedent which makes love and marriage the
most popular theme for jests. That the lady in
question had become Mrs. Hitchcock just three
days after meeting her future husband furnished
a partial excuse for the levity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hitchcock denies that there is anything
hasty in his romantic marriage," wrote the reporter.
"When asked if he considered a three
days' acquaintance a sufficient prelude to matrimony,
he smilingly replied that he preferred
three thousand years. In explanation of his
enigmatic remark, Mr. Hitchcock gave his views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
on reincarnation, while in the background Mrs.
Hitchcock blushed assent. Both are convinced
that, to quote Mr. Hitchcock, 'they were soul
mates when the pyramids were in building,
lovers in Babylon&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Priscilla suddenly crumpled the paper in her
hand. The familiar phrases were like a dash
of cold water, rousing her from her daze. "I'm
free," she cried, "I'm free! I'm free!" and
broke into violent weeping.</p>

<p>Peggy rang several times without attracting
attention. When at length she put her finger
to the button and held it there, Priscilla woke
to the realization that there was some one at
the door. She crept downstairs, unconsciously
holding fast to the paper that had announced
her release, and admitted a justly incensed
Peggy.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you need some of those artificial
ear-drums, Priscilla&mdash;Why, what's happened?"
Peggy's attempted irony changed to
affectionate concern, as she saw Priscilla with
her tear-streaked cheeks and eyes inflamed and
swollen. She threw her arms around her
friend, her imagination running the gamut of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
possible calamities. "Oh, what is the matter?"
she pleaded.</p>

<p>It seemed to Priscilla that a verbal explanation
was beyond her. Dumbly she held out the
crumpled sheet. Peggy caught sight of
Horace's smug smile, snatched the paper from
Priscilla's hand, and read the incredible story
at a glance. The blood rushed to her brain,
dying even her ears crimson. Rage shook her.
For the instant, the gentle Peggy was a silent
fury.</p>

<p>Priscilla roused herself to the need of explanation.
"Peggy!"</p>

<p>Peggy whirled upon her. "My dear, it is
the most abominable thing I ever heard of, but
you couldn't have cared for him, Priscilla. Oh,
tell me you didn't."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;well, we were engaged."</p>

<p>"Engaged," choked Peggy. She took a backward
step, looked at Priscilla's disfigured face,
and dug her nails deep into her palms. "Oh,
I wish I were a man," she breathed in a voice
hardly recognizable.</p>

<p>Priscilla uttered a choked laugh. Combined
with the fact that the tears were still running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
down her face, this did not tend to allay Peggy's
apprehensions. But as the laugh seemed to
unlock Priscilla's tongue, her distressed
friend was not long kept in suspense.</p>

<p>"I suppose I looked as if I were heart-broken,"
exclaimed Priscilla, laughing and
crying. "Yes, we were really engaged, Peggy,
but you can't imagine what a nightmare it has
been."</p>

<p>"A nightmare," gasped Peggy. "Your engagement
a nightmare!" She put her hands
to her head as if the unexpected information
acquired in the last few minutes had crowded
it to the bursting point.</p>

<p>"Wait, Peggy! I've had a dreadful time,
but it's been my own fault. I blame myself for
everything that has happened. If it hadn't
been for my silly vanity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vanity&mdash;" interrupted Peggy, and sniffed
her scorn.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can sneer, Peggy Raymond, but
I've been a silly little fool. In the first place, I
made myself miserable because nobody wanted
me."</p>

<p>"Priscilla," Peggy interrupted again, "I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
you ought to go to bed. You're talking
as if you were delirious."</p>

<p>"I know perfectly well what I'm saying,
Peggy. You were engaged to Graham, and
Nelson was in love with Ruth and Bob Carey
was getting very attentive to Amy, and I was
the only one left out and I resented it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," cried Peggy incredulously,
"that you don't know that you're so handsome
that people are always turning to look after
you when you pass?"</p>

<p>Priscilla laughed. "I won't choke you off,
Peggy. After that news&mdash;" she nodded significantly
toward the paper. "I fancy I can
stand a little flattery and not be injured. But
anyway I was sour and sore when Horace began
to call. I knew exactly what Horace was,
Peggy, but I shut my eyes to it. I wouldn't
criticize him even in my thoughts. I wouldn't
let you laugh at him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't I know it!" Peggy drew a long
breath. "That was one of the things that made
me anxious."</p>

<p>"Well, when he told me&mdash;that he cared for
me, I just snatched at him, Peggy. I was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
delighted that somebody thought I was
attractive. And I was such a silly little fool
that I actually gloated over being the second
girl out of us four to get engaged. Peggy,
I'm terribly ashamed to tell you all this, but
now's the time to finish up the subject and be
done with it."</p>

<p>"Priscilla darling, I can understand everything
except your feeling that way about yourself."</p>

<p>"Of course I wasn't happy," Priscilla went
on. "I don't know whether Horace was or not.
He always talked in a dreadfully pessimistic
fashion, but I rather think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a pose," interpolated Peggy witheringly.
"Even when he was a little boy, Horace
was always playing a part."</p>

<p>"Once or twice I tried to tell him I thought
we had made a mistake. When I thought of
going on and on through the years it didn't
seem as if I could bear it. And then he talked
so dreadfully, Peggy, and I was afraid he'd kill
himself."</p>

<p>"No such luck," snorted Priscilla's audience.
It was hard to believe that it was really Peggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
making such a speech and looking so fierce and
angry. Priscilla interrupted her story by a
little hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"The last time was only two weeks ago at
the foot-ball game. He was so disagreeable
that I tried again to get out of it, and then he
took it so to heart that I gave up all hope of
ever being free. When I read that account
today, and it came over me all at once that
I needn't ever see Horace Hitchcock again, it
seemed as if I'd die of joy. I believe I should
have, too, if I hadn't begun to cry."</p>

<p>Peggy was still scornful. "The idea of your
sacrificing yourself for such a fellow as
Horace."</p>

<p>"Only because I was to blame, Peggy. As
long as my silly vanity had got me into such a
scrape, I thought nothing was too bad for me."</p>

<p>"Didn't it ever occur to you that two wrongs
didn't make a right? If you were wrong in
getting engaged to Horace when you didn't love
him, marrying him without love would be a
million times wickeder."</p>

<p>Priscilla took the reproof meekly. "Perhaps
so. Anyway, I have learned my lesson. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
wrong man is so much worse than no man at all
that now I'm perfectly resigned to being an
old maid."</p>

<p>Peggy sniffed derisively. "You talk about
your silly vanity. You certainly were silly
enough, but when it comes to vanity, why, Priscilla
Combs, you're the most painfully modest
girl I know. The timid violet is a monster of
arrogance compared to you. I adore Ruth and
Amy, as everybody knows, but when it comes
to looks, they're simply not in it alongside you.
You're handsome, Priscilla, just as Horace's
dreadful old aunt said, and you're talented and
you're charming, and lots of men would fall in
love with you in a minute if they thought they
had the ghost of a chance."</p>

<p>Priscilla clapped her hands over her ears
and blushed till Peggy's eloquence lost itself
in laughter. "I'm not going to be punished by
having to marry Horace," she said, when at
length she judged it safe to lower her defenses.
"But I shan't get off scott-free. Just think,
Peggy, how many people in this city will be
sorry for me, because I've been jilted by
Horace Hitchcock."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>PEGGY COMES TO A DECISION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was mid-afternoon on a crisp February
day when Graham called Peggy on the phone.
In his preliminary "Hello" she detected an
unwonted note of excitement.</p>

<p>"Hello, Graham. Yes, it's Peggy."</p>

<p>"I want you to take dinner with me to-night."</p>

<p>"Take dinner? Why, I can't possibly, Graham.
I've got quite a lot of cramming to do
for the mid-year examinations. And I haven't
even looked at my lessons for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Hang your lessons."</p>

<p>Peggy pricked up her ears. "What did you
say?" she queried incredulously.</p>

<p>"I said, 'Hang your lessons,' and I'll add,
'Hang your examinations.' I've got to see
you and have a long talk."</p>

<p>One of the advantages of habitual faithfulness
to duty is that the rare relapse into irresponsibility
comes as a delightful holiday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Peggy's face suddenly crinkled into a charming
smile. It was a pity Graham could not
see it.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she said demurely, "if it's terribly
important&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I must let you have your
way."</p>

<p>"I'll call for you at half past six and we'll
dine at the McLaughlin."</p>

<p>"The McLaughlin! You haven't happened
to come into a fortune since last evening, have
you!"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. It's a celebration."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"That's telling. See you at six-thirty, Peggy
darling. Good-by." And Graham rang off
in a hurry, as if he feared her powers of
persuasion, and suspected that if he gave her
half a chance she would have the whole story
out of him over the wire.</p>

<p>Peggy went back to her books with a smile
which proved her thinking of something very
different from history or economics. She was
well aware that she would go to the class next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
day without her usual careful preparation, but
having made up her mind to accede to Graham's
request, she had no intention of spoiling her
pleasure by thinking of slighted tasks. And
though she made a valiant effort at concentration
in the short time left her for study, her
attempt was not particularly successful. The
dinner was a celebration, Graham had said.
She racked her brain to recall some anniversary
that had momentarily escaped her recollection,
but without results.</p>

<p>Peggy was dressed by six o'clock, having
spent an unprecedentedly long time over her
toilet. The McLaughlin, though not the largest
hotel in the city, was one of the most exclusive,
and the costumes seen in the dining-room
were frequently of an elegance compared with
which Peggy's little evening frock was almost
dowdy. But neither at the McLaughlin nor
elsewhere was one likely to see a face more
charming than that which looked back at Peggy
from her mirror, so that her haunting fear that
Graham might be ashamed of her was entirely
unfounded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond left the dining table to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the young couple off. "Have a good time,
dears," she said, and was pleased but not surprised
when Graham followed Peggy's example,
and stooping kissed her. She stood
at the window looking after them as they went
down the street. What a dear boy Graham
was! In the far-off, nebulous future when
Peggy began to think of being married, she
could trust her to Graham without a fear. And
then they would live near, where she could see
Peggy every day. Mrs. Raymond told herself
she would not have anything different.</p>

<p>"Mother," called Mr. Raymond's voice from
the dining-room, "your dinner's getting cold."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Peggy, tilting her head on one
side like an inquisitive canary, was asking
Graham, "What is it we are going to celebrate?"</p>

<p>"Washington's birthday and the Fourth of
July, Christmas and New Year's."</p>

<p>"Now, Graham, really I want to know."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when the time comes. It's not
the sort of thing to be sprung on the street."</p>

<p>"Oh, how interesting!" But though Peggy
stopped asking questions, her curiosity grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
prodigiously. Silent as Graham was as to the
occasion of this unwonted festivity, she realized
that there was about him an atmosphere of
suppressed excitement. Sometimes, when his
eyes were on her, he seemed to be looking
through her at something big in the distance.
Peggy was at the age when thrills and mysteries
are always welcome. She climbed aboard
the street-car all a-tingle with pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>The dining-room at the McLaughlin impressed
Peggy with its grandeur. The hour was
still early for fashionable diners, and less than
half of the tables were occupied. But the rows
of waiters in black clothes and gleaming shirt
fronts, and the scrape of violins in the background,
gave Peggy an uneasy sense of being
out of place. But Graham, convinced that he
was escorting the queen rose of the rose-bud
garden of girls, walked to his place as sure of
himself as a young prince. And what he saw
in Peggy's eyes was not of a sort to lessen his
self-confidence.</p>

<p>Peggy soon perceived that her customary
little hints regarding economy were to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
no weight on this particular occasion. Graham
began with oysters and then appealed to Peggy
as to her choice in soups. And perceiving that
he was determined to be extravagant, for all
she could say or do, Peggy gave herself up to
enjoying the fruits of his extravagance. This
was clearly Graham's night. Peggy decided
not to ask again about his secret till he told
her of his own accord.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/facing247.jpg" width="317" height="500" alt="Peggy and Graham sitting at a table" />
<div class="caption">"PEGGY LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT REPLYING"</div>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Graham seemed in no
hurry to take her into his confidence. The meal
went on through its leisurely courses, the tables
about them gradually filling, till the attentive
waiter set their dessert before them&mdash;French
pastries with small cups of deliciously fragrant
coffee. Peggy tasted and sipped and smiled,
and looked across the table with such an air
of radiant happiness that if Graham had kept
the smallest fragment of a heart in his possession,
he would have been forced to surrender
it on the spot.</p>

<p>He laid down his fork and leaned toward her.
"Peggy, I've got my promotion."</p>

<p>"Oh, Graham!"</p>

<p>"They want me to go to South America for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
two years," Graham continued, speaking with
curious breathlessness. "They're not asking
me to stay permanently, you understand. But
they want a man here who's thoroughly
familiar with conditions down there."</p>

<p>Peggy looked at him without replying, all
the radiant happiness drained from her face.
South America! Her sensations were almost
the same as when he went to France, except that
now she had no patriotic ardor to sustain her.
He was to be away two years, and yet his mood
was exultant, and he seemed to expect her congratulations.</p>

<p>Peggy rallied her courage and lifted her eyes
with a wan little smile. "When&mdash;when do they
want you to go?" Her fork clattered against
her plate, and she laid it down. She conceived
on the instant an intense loathing for French
pastry.</p>

<p>"In July."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Peggy winked hard. It would be a
shame to spoil that beautiful dinner by crying.
And besides, it was a long time before Graham
would have to go, from February to July.
Then a dreadful thought wrung her heart. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
six months was a long time, what of two
years?</p>

<p>Graham's face seemed to waver as he leaned
toward her across the little round table. His
voice sounded far-off and unfamiliar. "What
do you say, Peggy? Shall we go?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;what are you talking about Graham?"</p>

<p>"You're always saying how you'd love to
travel. Don't you see this is your chance."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I do. Won't you marry me,
Peggy, and go along? I can't leave you for
two years. I can't. When I came back from
the other side I promised myself I'd never be
separated from you again by anything less than
a world war. If I went by myself, Peggy, it
would be going into exile for two years. But
with you along, it would be a two-years' honeymoon.
Think what it would be to see those new
countries together."</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be a good thing for our
Spanish," said Peggy, and the inane remark
set them both to laughing, which undoubtedly
was a good thing. When the paroxysm was
over, Peggy wiped her eyes and struggled to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
reasonable. "But, Graham, I don't graduate
till the twelfth of June."</p>

<p>"And I don't sail till the sixth of July.
Loads of time."</p>

<p>"But I always meant to earn my living for
a few years after I graduated, before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have stood for that, Peggy, not
if I was making enough to take care of you,
and I shall be."</p>

<p>Peggy was breathing fast. It was hard to
realize that she and Graham were sitting there
in the McLaughlin dining-room, discussing the
question of whether or not they should be
married in July. For except on one memorable
occasion, when Graham had been on the point
of going across and Peggy had been ready to
marry him at a moment's notice, she had felt
about her marriage much as her mother did, as
if it belonged to the misty, distant, indeterminate
future. And now the six months she had
assured herself was a long time had dwindled
down almost to nothing. July! It was incredibly,
overwhelmingly near.</p>

<p>"We'll have to see what father and mother
think." She tried to make her voice matter-of-fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
but it had an unnatural tension. Graham
on the other side of the little table, nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>"Of course we'll see what they think. But
we know they can say only one thing. It's
such a reasonable solution that only one opinion
is possible. Don't you like your dessert,
Peggy? Won't you have some ice-cream?"</p>

<p>Peggy protested she liked her desert, and
finished it without tasting a morsel. Then they
went home and proceeded to bomb the peaceful
Raymond household with Graham's astounding
proposition. And while Mrs. Raymond
began by pronouncing it out of the question, before
the evening ended she was driven to admit
the reasonableness of Graham's plan. It was
true that Peggy's marriage would follow rather
closely on the heels of her graduation, but
thanks to common-sense hours of sleep, and an
abundance of outdoor exercise, she had come
through her four years' college course in
radiant health. A separation of two years just
now would be hard for both, and especially for
Graham. Indeed Graham frankly declared
that he would not go without Peggy, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to refuse such a chance was to prejudice his
future success.</p>

<p>When Peggy went to bed that night she knew
the whole thing was settled. To be sure, both
her father and mother had warned her against
a hasty decision, insisting that she take plenty
of time to think the matter over. But Peggy
knew what the final verdict would be, and she
was sure Graham also knew it, by the triumph
in his eyes as he kissed her good night.</p>

<p>Changes! She lay in her little white bed and
thought of the new life opening before her,
strange countries, unfamiliar tongues, alien
customs, even the dear, friendly constellations
replaced by unknown stars. And the queerest
part of all was that she herself would no longer
be Peggy Raymond, but a strange young woman,
Margaret Wylie by name. Peggy gave a little
incredulous laugh. It was astonishing how the
world had turned upside down since morning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>A PARTIAL ECLIPSE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wedding day was set for the second of
July, and after that decision had been reached,
Peggy professed a complete loss of interest in
the subject. When Graham consulted her on
details more or less important, she gave him a
reluctant attention.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Graham, I don't want to think
about it. I never did enjoy mixed flavors. I
shall have years and years of being Mrs.
Graham Wylie, fifty or sixty probably, and
there's only a few months left of my college
life."</p>

<p>"If you feel so keenly on the subject," teased
Graham, "we'd better postpone our wedding,
and let you take a post-graduate course of ten
years or so."</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary. I know I shall
love my wedding clothes, and my wedding day,
and being married to you, and everything. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
if I let myself think of that, I'll spoil this, don't
you see? It would be like eating ice-cream
with soup."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall be allowed to call occasionally."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! Of course I should be
wretched if I didn't see you every day. But
unless you have to settle something very important
about South America, don't ask my
opinion. Up to the twelfth of June, I'm a
college senior, first, last and all the time."</p>

<p>Peggy was as good as her word. As far as
her conversation revealed, she never looked
beyond Commencement Day. And if it was inevitable
that her thoughts should be more unruly
than her tongue, her mental excursions
into the future were surprisingly few. Peggy
had never been a girl to discount to-day in
favor of to-morrow, and this life-long habit
aided her in her determination to extract the
full flavor from the present.</p>

<p>While Peggy had thoroughly enjoyed her
college life, college associations had naturally
never meant to her what they mean to a girl
who leaves home to complete her education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Although she was popular in her class, her
closest friends were the girls who had been her
intimates long before her high-school days,
even, and she enjoyed her home so thoroughly
that it never occurred to her to regret having
missed the associations of dormitory life. But
now she gave herself so unreservedly to her
college interests that no on-looker would have
dreamed that any event of special importance
had been scheduled for early July.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Peggy could hardly have
done justice to her varied duties in connection
with Commencement, had she brought to them a
divided attention. Her knack at rhyming had
resulted in her election as class poet, and the
same gift, doubtless, had caused her to be
chosen one of the editorial staff of the Annual,
gotten out each spring by the senior class.
Moreover she had a part, though a small one, in
the class play that was to be given out-of-doors
and promised to be one of the most interesting
features of commencement week. Since even
for seniors there were lessons to be learned,
and examinations to be passed, it is no wonder
that Peggy found herself quite occupied without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
giving thought to the great changes on
ahead.</p>

<p>While she struggled with her poem, which she
was determined as all class laureates, to make
a masterpiece, and scribbled off jokes for the
Annual and practised for the play, and studied
in her odd minutes, the days had a most disconcerting
fashion of shooting by without regard
to speed regulations. Every Saturday
night awoke in Peggy's mind the same incredulity.
Another week was gone&mdash;only it
couldn't be, for it was no time at all since last
Sunday morning. She had an unreasonable
impulse to clutch at the flying hours and hold
them fast.</p>

<p>But the last spring of her college life was
not to be altogether a season of flowers. One
afternoon at the close of recitations, Peggy
hunted up Ruth who had agreed to go with her
for a call on Mary Donaldson.</p>

<p>"Ruth, I'm sorry, but Priscilla and I are
going to be busy until after dinner time,
probably. It's the Annual again."</p>

<p>"That old Annual takes so much time,"
scolded Ruth, objecting on principle to anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that separated her from Peggy for these
few precious weeks. Poor Ruth was trying to
imitate Peggy's example and not look ahead,
but there were times when the coming desolation
settled over her spirits like a chilling fog.
With Peggy and Graham in South America,
and Nelson in Oklahoma, Ruth felt that existence
would be flat and flavorless.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it takes time." Peggy resolutely
ignored the undertone of tragedy in
Ruth's voice. "But somebody has to do it, and
anyway, it's fun."</p>

<p>It was due to her lingering to cheer the despondent
Ruth that Peggy was the last of the
Annual staff to reach the class room, which for
that particular evening had been promoted to
the dignity of an editorial sanctum. Peggy
made her entry on a somewhat hilarious scene.
Everybody was laughing, or so Peggy thought.
Had she been more observant she would have
noticed that Priscilla's face wore no smile, but
a look of anxiety, bordering on distress.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" inquired Peggy, as she
took her seat. Though the gathering was made
up of college seniors and was therefore a dignified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
deliberative assembly, its proceedings were
sometimes as informal as if they had been
merely a group of high-school girls.</p>

<p>By way of answer, a sheet of card-board that
evidently had made the rounds was put in her
hand. Peggy looked at it curiously. At the
top, under the heading, "The Misfit," was a
clever caricature representing a small man attired
in garments much too large for him. His
broad-brimmed hat came down over his ears,
his overcoat trailed on the ground, while the
umbrella he carried was more than double his
height. But the artist had avoided giving the
impression that he was a masquerading child by
bringing into prominence a somewhat scraggly
mustache.</p>

<p>Peggy smiled appreciatively at the undoubted
humor of the drawing and gave her attention
to the verses below. But though they showed
quite as much ability as the illustration, the
effect of reading them was to erase the smile
from her lips, leaving her gravely attentive.
The laughter had quieted. She was aware that
the girls were all watching her, and though she
did not raise her eyes, she knew instinctively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that Priscilla's face wore a look of apprehension.</p>

<p>The previous spring, one of the most popular
men in the English department had resigned to
devote himself to literary work, and his place
had been nominally filled by a young man with
good credentials but no experience. He had
proved a great disappointment, for whatever
his attainments, he lacked the ability to impart;
while in contrast to the enthusiasm which
Professor Baer's lectures had aroused, his
classes seemed veritable refrigerating plants.
Peggy knew that the seniors who had taken his
courses were complaining bitterly that they
had been "stung," and had congratulated herself
that her own work in English had been continued
with another member of the faculty.</p>

<p>In the verses before her, all the resentment
of the students toward an incompetent teacher,
following an able and popular one, was expressed
with diabolical cleverness. The fact
that the present incumbent was named Fox,
and that he followed Professor Baer, had
already been the theme of innumerable jokes,
and the author of the verses had used it as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
motive of her lines, so that there was no chance
that even the outsider would remain ignorant
of the instructor satirized.</p>

<p>Peggy read the verses over more than once
in order to gain time. She was sorely tempted
to say nothing. Peggy was under no illusions
regarding the path of the reformer. It was
vastly easier, vastly pleasanter, to let things
go. It was not that she had any cowardly
shrinking from hard knocks, but now, almost at
the close of her college life, she was not in the
mood to antagonize any one. She loved everything
about the college, its gray stone buildings
draped in ivy, its campus dotted with stately
trees, the class-rooms and the laboratories, the
dignified president, the professors and the girls&mdash;oh,
most of all, the girls. She loved to believe
in their affection, their admiration.
Never in her life had popularity meant as much
to her as now. And yet in spite of her distaste,
she knew she had no choice. She must disagree,
antagonize, anger.</p>

<p>When she lifted her eyes, the room was very
quiet, almost as if every one knew what she
was going to say. "Awfully clever, aren't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
they?" Peggy spoke very deliberately. "What
are they for?"</p>

<p>A dark-eyed girl across the room took it on
herself to answer, and as soon as her lips
parted, Peggy knew her for the author.</p>

<p>"I'd intended it for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,"
she smiled with frank sarcasm. "But I think
perhaps it's better suited to the Annual. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't think it's at all suited to
the Annual."</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of protests. "You
never were in his classes, Peggy," cried some
one from the rear seat. "If you'd endured
what we have at the hands of that man, you'd
love every line."</p>

<p>A burst of approving laughter showed how
completely the sympathies of this group of girls
were with the speaker. Half-whispered comments
were being exchanged. "The stupidest
lectures!" "The greatest waste of time!"
Peggy was perfectly able to understand this
point of view. She struggled to make the girls
see hers.</p>

<p>"Of course that's not right. If I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in his class I'd have been perfectly ready to go
to President Eaton, and tell him how unsatisfactory
everything was. But to take this way
of doing it&mdash;" she looked down at the mocking
lines and said with a visible effort, "Don't you
think it seems a little bit cowardly&mdash;and cruel,
too?"</p>

<p>Priscilla came to her friend's assistance. "If
the faculty knew about those verses, I'm sure
we'd never be allowed to put them in the
Annual."</p>

<p>"How's the faculty to know?" demanded the
criticized author, Ida Craig, with much asperity.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," suggested Peggy with all
the diplomacy she could muster, "that since
they leave it all to us, we're put on our honor
to see that nothing gets in that they could
object to?"</p>

<p>Ida smiled disagreeably. "After all," she
said, "you're not the editor-in-chief, you know."</p>

<p>The rudeness gave Peggy the courage that she
needed. "No, of course. I haven't any more
voice than any of the rest of you. But if the
poem goes in, I shall ask you to accept my
resignation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"In other words," exclaimed Ida, "If you
can't have your own way, you'll take your dolls
and go home."</p>

<p>"No indeed," Peggy was trying to speak
calmly, but her voice shook, "But if my name
appears among the editors of the Annual, it'll
be taken for granted that I approve of all that
is in it. I'm not willing to stand for anything
like this."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Priscilla. "I agree with
Peggy."</p>

<p>Ida Craig leaned toward the girl nearest her.
"Miss Combs is nothing if not original," she
said in an echoing stage-whisper audible to
every one in the room. But the editor-in-chief,
dismayed at the prospect of losing two of her
most reliable aides, hastily interposed.</p>

<p>"Now we mustn't get personal, girls," she
said. "You know how the newspapers are
always trying to make out that the members of
women's organizations do nothing but quarrel.
I think college graduates ought to disprove that
sort of thing." She looked at Peggy rather
appealingly. "I suppose you're willing to
abide by the will of the majority," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the majority vote to include 'The Misfit,'"
returned Peggy, "Of course that settles
it." And then as the face of the editor-in-chief
brightened, she added, "But I shall have
to resign, because the vote of the majority
can't decide a question of right and wrong for
me."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the editor-in-chief rather blankly,
and then she quickly rallied. "We'll decide
that question when we come to it," she said.
"Will the meeting please come to order."</p>

<p>The mooted question was not put to vote till
the end of the hour. "All in favor of including
'The Misfit' in the Annual," said the editor-in-chief,
after the motion had been duly
made, "please signify it by saying 'aye.'"</p>

<p>"Aye," chimed two defiant voices, that of
the author and her dearest friend in the class.</p>

<p>"Those opposed, 'No.'"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of 'noes,' indicating
that Peggy had won her fight, but she had none
of the elation of the victor. She realized that
several had not voted, and that those who had
espoused her side had acted from motives of
policy rather than conviction. Ida Craig was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
plainly offended, and as for the rest, Peggy
suspected that they failed to make the fine
distinction between standing up for one's
principles and being determined to have one's
way.</p>

<p>Those closing weeks of college life were not
all she had hoped. Peggy fancied a reserve in
the friendliness of her friends. She became
unnaturally sensitive, imagining slights where
none existed. She was troubled by the thought
that Priscilla shared in her partial eclipse of
popularity, and inclined to regard her uncompromising
conscience as a decided inconvenience,
if nothing worse.</p>

<p>But Peggy's stand was to have a tragic
justification. Three weeks before Commencement
the Annual came from the binders, looking
very attractive in its cover of blue and
white, the college colors. The editorial force
had been called together to make the necessary
arrangements for placing it on sale. Peggy
and Priscilla had an early class Wednesday
morning, and as they entered the hall on their
way to the cloak-room, they encountered
Phyllis Riordan, the Annual's editor-in-chief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Phyllis' greeting was more than cordial, but
Peggy hardly noticed that, in her concern for
the girl herself.</p>

<p>"Why, Phyllis," she cried. "What's the
matter? You're as white as a sheet."</p>

<p>Phyllis looked from one to the other. "You
haven't heard about Mrs. Fox?"</p>

<p>"What about her?" The question came
simultaneously from two pairs of lips.</p>

<p>"She died last night."</p>

<p>Peggy and Priscilla uttered a shocked exclamation.
They were both but slightly acquainted
with the girlish wife of the unpopular
professor of English, but intimacy was not
needed to point the tragedy of the news. Her
voice curiously tense, Phyllis continued.</p>

<p>"It seemed she had serious heart trouble,
and the doctor thought she ought to live in
a milder climate. Professor Fox has resigned,
and they were to locate in southern California.
And Oh, Peggy Raymond&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned suddenly toward Peggy, and
caught both of her hands. "Since I heard the
news last evening, I haven't been able to think
of anything else. Peggy, do you realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
what it would have meant if we had let that
poem of Ida's go in? We'd have had to destroy
the whole edition of the Annual. We
couldn't have done anything else."</p>

<p>Peggy changed color slightly, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>"You've saved our lives," declared Phyllis,
her eyes bright with tears. "If it hadn't been
for you, we'd have been in the worst box of
any class since the college was founded. And
when I think how brave you were, standing out
against us all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Phyllis," Peggy interposed, "I
wasn't brave at all. This&mdash;this dreadful thing
that has happened doesn't make me a bit more
right than I was in the beginning. And I
knew it, too, and yet I wasn't satisfied. I've
been ready to wish I hadn't done it a hundred
times. And when you call me brave, you make
me desperately ashamed, for nobody knows as
well as I do what a coward I've been."</p>

<p>"If you're cowardly, Peggy," cried Priscilla,
up in arms at once, "I'm sorry for the rest of
us."</p>

<p>"Heavens, I should say so," agreed Phyllis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
And then as the signal bell sounded, the
girls rushed for the cloak room. Blended
with Peggy's sorrow and her sense of humility,
was a gratifying certainty that the last
three weeks of her college life would be all she
had dreamed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>THE END OF SCHOOL LIFE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> senior banquet was the most intimate
and, in the opinion of many, the most delightful
festivity of Commencement. No guests were
invited. The only member of the faculty
present was the honorary member of the class,
a charming woman, who taught Greek and
talked slang&mdash;as an antidote, she was wont to
say. And because it was so strictly a class
affair, a great deal of fun was in order which
would have been impossible before ever so
limited an audience.</p>

<p>"What I like about it is that it's frankly
selfish," Peggy told Priscilla. And then noticing
Priscilla's expression of incredulity, "I
don't mean selfish in the mean sense, just the
nice, comfortable, homey sort. All the rest
of Commencement we're thinking about other
people, the Board of Trustees, and the fathers
and mothers, and the audience and the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
It's a comfort that there's one thing where we
don't have to think of any one but ourselves,
and we can be as silly as we please."</p>

<p>The first class to graduate had established a
precedent which every succeeding class had
strictly followed, that all engagements were to
be announced at the class banquet, Commencement
week. If for any reason it was preferred
that such announcements should be regarded
as confidential, it was understood that the
members of the class would be put to torture
rather than reveal a word. So strictly had a
few such items of news been guarded&mdash;in some
instances for several years&mdash;that the ability of
a woman to keep a secret had apparently been
satisfactorily demonstrated by the graduates
of Peggy's alma mater. As a rule, however,
the graduate who announced her engagement
at the class banquet was willing that all the
world should know the joyful news.</p>

<p>The banquet was held in the college
gymnasium, the long tables being arranged in
a hollow square. After the feasting was over,
the waiters were dismissed and the doors
closed to ensure perfect secrecy,&mdash;after which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
every girl engaged in the class was expected to
take her stand in the central enclosure, carrying
with her a photograph of her fiancé, the back of
the said photograph being duly inscribed with
her name and his. And as if this were not
enough, each was required to state in a few well-chosen
words the qualities which differentiated
her particular young man from all the rest of
mankind. At the conclusion of this unique
ceremony, the photographs were passed about
and duly inspected, and then a vote was taken to
determine the handsomest. The gentleman so
honored was presented with a stick-pin, which
his betrothed took charge of until such time as
she chose to deliver it.</p>

<p>As the girls dispatched their deviled crabs
and chicken salad and ice cream, and other incongruous
and indigestible dainties, the
thoughts of many turned expectantly toward
the ceremony immediately following the banquet.
It was true that some of the engagements
were no secret. Graham Wylie, for instance,
had been Peggy Raymond's devoted
cavalier ever since she graduated from high
school. And there were girls in the dormitories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
who heard so frequently and at such
length from certain men friends that they were
assumed to be engaged whether they admitted
it or not. But on the other hand there were
always surprises enough to render the occasion
exciting.</p>

<p>The ice cream was dispatched at last, along
with the cakes and candies. The little coffee
cups were emptied. The waiters cleared the
tables and withdrew, closing the door according
to instructions. And then from here and
there in the long rows of diners, one laughing
girl after another rose, and made her way into
the vacant space enclosed by the tables.</p>

<p>Priscilla's eye followed Peggy on her way,
blushing, laughing, and looking to Priscilla's
fond eyes the embodiment of girlish loveliness.
And then some one called her name. "Why,
Priscilla Combs!"</p>

<p>Priscilla turned. A classmate that she knew
only slightly was leaning across the table.
"Why aren't you going with the others?" she
cried.</p>

<p>"I?" Priscilla colored to the roots of her
hair. "I'm not eligible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come!" retorted the other archly.
"This isn't any time for prevarication, you
know. You're expected to tell the truth."</p>

<p>Some one caught the speaker by the arm, and
as she turned, hissed a terse statement in her
ear. Only too well did Priscilla know the import
of that whisper. Inaudible as it was, its
news might as well have been shouted. The
girl who had innocently assumed Priscilla's
engagement was now hearing that Horace
Hitchcock, after paying Priscilla every attention,
had met some one he liked better in New
York, and had married her after three days'
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Priscilla held her head high. She saw her
<i>vis-à-vis</i> change color and lift startled eyes.
When she found Priscilla regarding her, the
girl lost her head. "Oh, excuse me," she
gasped.</p>

<p>"Why certainly," laughed Priscilla. "I'm
like the man who was asked to change a
twenty-dollar bill. I appreciate the compliment."
But for all her cheerful air, the thing
rankled. Would they never be done pitying
her because she had been jilted by Horace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Hitchcock. It was impossible to explain, but
it really seemed to Priscilla that some of them
might suspect what a relief the termination of
that unacknowledged engagement had been.</p>

<p>There were now a dozen girls in the
enclosure. The appearance of some was
greeted with loud cries, intended to convey reproach,
or incredulity. Excited comments ran
around the tables. "Look, there's Cynthia,
after insisting that there wasn't a thing
between them." "Why, there's Anne Gordon."
"Now who in the world&mdash;" And while the
eager inspection went on, the twelve girls in
the middle stood rather close together as if
each found it a help in that trying moment to
feel she was not alone.</p>

<p>The talk and laughter quieted when the president
rapped for order. Eloise Hayden was
the first to be called on to introduce her fiancé
to her attentive classmates. Eloise was one of
the girls who affect the modern pose of matter-of-factness.
She was so afraid of undue sentimentality
that she went too far in the other
direction, like one who is so determined to be
straight as to bend backward. As Eloise's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
name was spoken, she stepped out from the
group, and held up to view the photograph she
carried.</p>

<p>"Friends and classmates, I am introducing
John Mackenzie Rowe. As you see, he is no
beauty, and he'll never wear the stick pin unless
it's given for a consolation prize. But on
the other hand, he isn't bad looking enough so
he needs to wear a mask when he goes on the
street."</p>

<p>The momentary silence as Eloise stopped for
breath was filled by a chorus of groans, Eloise's
classmates disapproving her extreme lack of
sentiment. Quite unabashed by this demonstration,
Eloise continued.</p>

<p>"John and I live in the country, as some of
you know. The only thing between his father's
place and my father's place is a privet
hedge, not high enough to be a barrier.
We've lived on the two sides of that
hedge since he was thirteen and I eleven. I
suppose if any other boy had lived there, I
should now be engaged to him. And if any
other girl had lived where I do, he would have
been engaged to her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The signs of displeasure redoubled. Mingled
with the groans were hisses, and Eloise,
who liked nothing better than to stir her friends
to protest against her nonchalant attitude, continued
blithely:</p>

<p>"Our engagement is in every way a sensible
one. Neither of us thinks the other perfect,
so we won't have the usual disillusionment
and disappointment after we are married.
I'm sorry I shan't be able to introduce John to
you to-morrow, but he wrote me that if he came
he would have to put off a business trip, and I
wrote him, 'Business first.'"</p>

<p>The demonstrations of disapproval were
now so marked that Eloise considered this a
good place to stop. She laid down the photograph
for the girls' inspection and stepped
back, seemingly very well satisfied with her
performance.</p>

<p>Judith West, a plump pink and white girl,
looking, thanks to her bobbed hair and round
face, not a day over fifteen, was next to be
called on. Judith blushed rosily as she held
up the photograph of a handsome young man
in a lieutenant's uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Philip Carpenter," she announced
in a faint, frightened voice. "And all I can
say is that he's as good as he looks."</p>

<p>"He looks good enough to eat," encouraged
an admiring voice from a side-table.</p>

<p>"He is," declared Judith. "At least&mdash;well,
you know what I mean. He's just as nice as
he can be, and after I'd seen him once, nobody
else in the world had the least chance."</p>

<p>As this impressed the class as the proper
attitude for an engaged girl, the applause was
hearty, and the blushing Judith interpreted it
as a <i>finish</i> to her remarks, and retreated
in charming confusion. But the applause
dropped into instantaneous silence as Anne
Gordon arose. Anne's appearance in the
enclosure had surprised every one.</p>

<p>"I haven't much of a photograph to show
you," said Anne holding up a kodak picture in
which three diminutive figures appeared seated
under an apple tree. "The one in the middle
is Elmer Wharton. He looks very tiny, but
believe me, he's longer than our engagement."</p>

<p>Anne stopped to laugh, and the class laughed
with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had a letter from Elmer yesterday,"
Anne continued, "a very particular letter. I
can't say it was a great surprise to me, though
you all seem so astonished. And in this letter
Elmer told me a number of things he meant to
say to me as soon as I got home. But I
thought of to-night, and I couldn't see why I
shouldn't be engaged the day before Commencement
as well as the day after. So I
telegraphed him, <i>yes</i>."</p>

<p>Amid the shrieks of laughter due to this
frank acknowledgment, Peggy was called, and
she held up her photograph with an engaging
pride.</p>

<p>"I fancy there aren't many of you who need
to be introduced to Graham Wylie, for he's
been very much in evidence ever since I
entered college. I don't know any way of
doing justice to the subject, but when I feel
strongly about anything, I'm very likely to
drop into poetry, like Mr. Wegg."</p>

<p>Peggy, who had been brought up on Dickens
as if she had been a girl of the fifties, had
forgotten how few of her contemporaries had
ever heard of Mr. Wegg. Warned of her slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by the blank faces that looked back at her, she
began to recite the lines she had written in sheer
desperation the previous evening, after she
was supposed to be in bed.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"It isn't because he's six feet two<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With shoulders to match his height,</span><br />
That I'm happy and proud to be facing you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On this very eventful night.</span><br />
<br />
"It isn't because his face is fine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clear-cut, like a cameo,</span><br />
That I value the right to call him mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More than any one here can know.</span><br />
<br />
"It isn't because he's so very wise;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We both could improve right there.</span><br />
His faults are plain to the kindest eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I know that I have my share.</span><br />
<br />
"He's not perfection&mdash;to hint at this<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would waken his scornful mirth.</span><br />
And yet he has made me&mdash;just as he is&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The happiest girl on earth.</span><br />
<br />
"I know he is built of the sterling stuff<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of which manly men are made.</span><br />
And that glad certainty is enough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To render me unafraid.</span><br />
<br />
"As we scatter to go our devious ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like sparks from the anvil hurled,</span><br />
I want you to think of me all your days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the proudest girl in the world."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The applause that greeted Peggy's effort
was not due chiefly to the quality of her verses,
nor even to the charm of her undisguised happiness.
The Editorial Staff of the Annual
had leaked out. It had been whispered about
that if it had not been for Peggy's protests,
the Annual would have contained a satirical
attack on a stricken man, which would
have rendered its circulation impossible. The
clapping died down, and then broke out again,
as if to emphasize the fact that it was a personal
tribute.</p>

<p>And so one after another, the girls in the
enclosure introduced the possessors of the
names they themselves would some day bear,
and having finished, went laughing back to
their seats. The photographs were passed
about for examination and the ballots distributed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
The voting was a somewhat protracted
process due, doubtless, to the fact that so much
was at stake. But in course of time the ballots
were collected and the judges retired to count
them, the girls filling in the interval with
college songs.</p>

<p>The announcement of the result of the
balloting came as a great surprise to Peggy.
For the recipient of the stick pin was not
Graham but Philip Carpenter. Judith, blushing
very prettily, made the speech of acceptance
in behalf of her fiancé, and took the
pin.</p>

<p>"I wish to say to you all," said the class
president, "that twenty-five dollars is deposited
with the treasurer for the purchase of a
wedding-present for the first of our number to
marry. I can only say it can't be spent too
soon to suit me. It's time," she added
severely, "that somebody was disproving the
slander that college women care only for civic
reform and settlement work and teaching
school, and that home and husbands don't
matter to them at all."</p>

<p>Priscilla glanced discreetly in Peggy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
direction, but Peggy was looking at the table.
Indeed her expression remained thoughtful till
the first toast was given, and she stood with
the others to drink to her alma mater in a
draught of fruit punch.</p>

<p>It was not till they were on their way home
that Priscilla discovered the reason for Peggy's
temporary abstraction. For while they were
talking of something entirely different, Peggy
suddenly exclaimed, "Do you suppose it was
the uniform that dazzled them?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you, Peggy."</p>

<p>"Why, that vote, you know. Of course
Judith's lieutenant is a very good looking
fellow, but the idea of comparing him to
Graham."</p>

<p>Priscilla looked at her friend askance and
said nothing.</p>

<p>"I have a photograph of Graham in uniform,"
Peggy continued, "and now I wish
I'd brought that. But I hadn't any idea it
would count so much."</p>

<p>"Peggy," began Priscilla faintly. "Will you
promise not to be angry if I tell you something?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course. Why should I be angry?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I voted for Philip Carpenter."</p>

<p>Peggy looked at her in seemingly speechless
amazement. "But why?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, there could be only one
reason for that, Peggy, because I thought him
the handsomest man in the collection. His
nose is wonderful."</p>

<p>"And so is Graham's. I never saw a more
perfect nose."</p>

<p>"Philip's eyes are so big and beautiful."</p>

<p>"A little <i>too</i> big, it seems to me. It gives
him a rather girly look. Now Graham's eyes
are just large enough."</p>

<p>Priscilla burst into an irrepressible shriek of
laughter. "I wonder if it ever occurred to you,
Peggy, that you might be a little bit prejudiced."</p>

<p>It was plain that such an idea had never occurred
to Peggy. She looked blank for a
moment and then joined in Priscilla's helpless
laughter. "I suppose," she owned when again
she could find her voice, "that it's just as well
that tastes differ."</p>

<p>They parted at Priscilla's door, kissing each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
other good-night, a somewhat unusual ceremony,
far they were not girls who made a
parade of affection. Peggy, who had started
toward her own home, suddenly turned back as
if she had forgotten something. Priscilla
hurried down the steps to meet her.</p>

<p>"Priscilla, do you realize that to-morrow is
Commencement Day? What a little time it
seems since we entered as Freshman. Don't
you remember how scared we were, and how in
awe of the Seniors? And now, Priscilla our
school life is over."</p>

<p>And much to Priscilla's astonishment, and
even more to her own, Peggy burst into tears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>A SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Rather</span> to the surprise of those who knew
her best, Peggy had decided on a church
wedding. But when she came to give her
reasons, the decision seemed characteristic,
after all.</p>

<p>"I think this is the dearest house in the
world. When Graham and I come back from
South America, I hope we can find one just like
it&mdash;and on Friendly Terrace, too. But it's
not what you'd call spacious. A dozen extra
people crowd it, and it makes you uncomfortable
to have a wedding and leave out so many."</p>

<p>"Our wedding seems likely to be a unique
affair," grinned Graham. "From the looks of
Peggy's list, the guests will make up in variety
what they lack in exclusiveness. What do you
think of her asking the Bonds?"</p>

<p>"Now, Graham, that's not fair. I haven't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
any idea of asking the Bond family. I only
said that Elvira had improved so much that I
felt like encouraging her by sending her an
invitation."</p>

<p>"And the Dunns. She's got them down."
For all matrimonial responsibilities loomed so
close, Graham's boyish fondness for teasing
remained one of his most prominent characteristics.</p>

<p>"Why, Graham Wylie! Not the Dunns at
all. Just Jimmy! And he's doing so well and
looks as nice as any boy."</p>

<p>"And she says she's going to have her
Sunday school class, one and all."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think so. I've taught those
girls ever since they came out of the infant
room, and they're darlings. And it would
break their hearts if I were married and they
weren't there to see."</p>

<p>Now that her college life was over, Peggy
had thrown herself joyously into her planning
for the next thing. Ruth, as Graham's sister,
was to be the maid of honor, Priscilla and Amy
bridesmaids. They decided on their gowns
after hours and hours of delicious deliberation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
For a July wedding, organdie was the thing&mdash;the
sheerest pale pink organdie, with pink roses
to match on their wide hats. "You'll be
dreams," Peggy declared ecstatically. "Everybody'll
say so."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" scoffed Amy, "As if people at
a wedding ever looked at anybody but the
bride!"</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Alice, yesterday," exclaimed
Peggy, changing the subject. "She
thinks little Irma had better be the flower-girl
instead of Dorothy. She says Dorothy has
been shooting up so fast lately, that now she's
lanky and self-conscious, and that Irma is
plump and adorable. I only hope dear little
Dorothy won't feel left out. That would spoil
everything."</p>

<p>Robert Carey was to be Graham's best man,
a decision which pleased Peggy immensely.
Most of the ushers were young men the girls
knew more or less, though Graham had included
in the number a comparative new-comer at the
office, Kennedy by name, with whom he was on
especially friendly terms. "You ought to
bring him out some evening," suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Peggy, "and not wait till just before the
wedding to introduce him."</p>

<p>"No, that's right. I'll ask him to-morrow to
set a time."</p>

<p>When Graham appeared shortly after dinner
the following evening, Peggy and Priscilla were
addressing invitations. Graham seated himself
lazily in the arm chair and congratulated
them on their industry. "Have you addressed
all that pile to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We've been working ever since I
got back from the dressmaker's, about four
o'clock. Priscilla stayed to dinner so as not to
lose any time."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Two pairs of pens
scratched busily while Graham entertained
himself by watching the anxious pucker of
Peggy's mouth as she wrote each new address.
"By the way," he remarked, "He's coming out
to-night."</p>

<p>"Who is?"</p>

<p>"Kennedy."</p>

<p>The scratching of the pens came to an abrupt
stop. "Priscilla," Peggy cried in tones of
horror, "Graham has asked that Mr. Kennedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to call and he's coming this evening."</p>

<p>"You told me to ask him," Graham defended
himself.</p>

<p>"Of course, I want him to come. But I don't
want him to descend on me without warning,
and get the impression that you are going to
marry a frump."</p>

<p>"Why, I was just thinking how nice you
looked&mdash;both of you," Graham declared,
kindly including Priscilla, who scorned to
acknowledge the compliment. She rose, returned
her pen to the writing desk, and said
briefly, "I'm off."</p>

<p>"Put on your glad rags and come back, Priscilla,"
begged Peggy, who also was making
preparations for a retreat.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think not. Mr. Kennedy isn't coming
to see me."</p>

<p>"It'll be ever so much nicer if he meets some
of you before the last minute. Ruth says she's
got to put in this evening letter writing, and
Amy and Bob are going somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. I'll be back after a little."
Priscilla spoke nonchalantly, but as a matter
of fact, she was glad of Peggy's insistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Now that the time was growing so short, she
grudged every hour she was away from her
friend. As she left by the door, Peggy ran up
the stairs, leaving Graham to the companionship
of his own agreeable anticipations.</p>

<p>Peggy was back in about twenty minutes,
looking, in Graham's estimation, very much the
same, except that her dress was a lighter blue
than the other, and her hair, having been freshly
combed, did not show as much of the curl. He
expressed his opinion and Peggy smiled
tolerantly.</p>

<p>"I wore that old thing because a drop of ink
more or less wouldn't matter. It's as old as
the hills, and I made it when I didn't know as
much about dress-making as I do now. Of
course I like to have you think I look nice, no
matter what I wear, but now you're going to
be married, you'd better learn more discrimination
in regard to clothes. It would be dreadful
to have a new dress and you not able to see
that it was any prettier than the old one."</p>

<p>"Very well. Suppose you start on my education
right away. Tell me the fine points
about the rig you've got on." But before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Peggy could begin, the bell rang, and Graham's
education was left incomplete for the time
being.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy was a slender, pleasant-mannered
young man, who looked considerably
older than Graham, partly perhaps, because he
wore eye-glasses. As Peggy greeted him, she
was conscious of something hauntingly familiar
in his face. "I haven't met you before, have
I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It hardly seems that I could have met you
and not remember it," said young Kennedy
gallantly. "I'm very sure I've seen you before,
however."</p>

<p>"And I believe I've seen you, but I don't
know where."</p>

<p>"Hitchcock would say," remarked Graham,
"that probably you had been well acquainted in
Nineveh or Babylon or some other ancient
burg."</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy smiled, and took the chair
Graham had pulled forward for him. "Who's
Hitchcock?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, a nut that Peggy used to have here till
I told her she'd have to choose between us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Graham, what a misleading thing to say."</p>

<p>"Well, it might give the wrong impression, I
confess. Peggy didn't care much about him
herself, but one of her friends had a case on
him."</p>

<p>"Sh!" warned Peggy, in an agony as she
heard Priscilla's footsteps outside. She filled
the somewhat awkward pause by springing to
her feet, crying as she ran to the door, "You
needn't ring; I hear you."</p>

<p>The results of the half hour Priscilla had
given to vanity were more evident, Graham
thought, than in Peggy's case. Peggy could
be disheveled and still irresistible. Priscilla's
rather stately beauty was more exacting in its
demands. In her dress of pale green voile,
which set off her clear pallor and the beauty of
her smooth, dark hair, she looked the incarnate
spirit of spring. Even Graham stared.</p>

<p>Peggy, her arm slipped caressingly through
Priscilla's, led her forward. "Priscilla, this
is Graham's friend, Mr. Kennedy. Miss
Combs&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peggy stopped short. Priscilla had jumped.
Mr. Kennedy's conventional smile had changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to startled recognition. "Why, you know each
other," Peggy cried.</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;why, surely, Peggy, you remember."</p>

<p>Peggy's vague, irritating certainty of something
familiar in Mr. Kennedy's face was suddenly
transformed to recollection. "Oh, of
course. The Green Parrot."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course! The Green Parrot!" mocked
Graham, who had risen on Priscilla's entrance,
and now stood looking from one to another of
the trio. "Makes it perfectly clear."</p>

<p>They took their seats, and Peggy explained,
helped out by suggestions from the others.
As they recalled the absurd experience, the
three narrators went off into fits of laughter,
but the audience maintained a dignified calm.</p>

<p>"Take my word for it, John, it's an inscrutable
sex. Now, I would have sworn that this
young woman hadn't a thought I didn't share,
and look what she's been keeping from me, lo!
these many months. When we're alone I shall
expect you to give me a full account of what
really happened."</p>

<p>For some reason the discovery that Graham's
friend, Kennedy, was the young man whose coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
cup had been invaded by Priscilla's roll
seemed to put him at once on the footing of an
old acquaintance. They had a very jolly evening,
and it was not till after ten that Priscilla
said, "Graham, I think you'd better take me
home, now. I've got a busy day before me."</p>

<p>"You have indeed, poor dear," Peggy cried.
"I expect you to finish addressing those invitations
and do any number of errands. These
are trying times for my friends, Mr. Kennedy.
They have hardly a minute in the twenty-four
hours that they can call their own."</p>

<p>The young man smiled at her in the abstracted
fashion of one whose thoughts are on
something else. "Won't you let me be your escort?"
he asked Priscilla. "It would give me
the greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but it's only a step, and my going
early won't break up Graham's evening, for
he'll come directly back." She softened her
refusal by giving him her hand and saying
pleasantly, "I'm glad to have met you properly
at last, with a real introduction, you
know."</p>

<p>"I shall look forward to the next time," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
young Kennedy, with rather more ardor than
conventional courtesy required. "This is our
third meeting, I believe."</p>

<p>"Third?" exclaimed Peggy, pricking up her
ears. "Why, when was the second?"</p>

<p>"At one of the football games last fall," explained
Priscilla. "I was there with Horace
Hitchcock, and Mr. Kennedy sat next me."
And then recalling the suspicious glances Horace
had shot in the direction of the guiltless Mr.
Kennedy, Priscilla began to blush. The worst
of blushing is that it is much easier to start it
than to call a halt. There were innumerable
things connected with the thought of Horace
that made Priscilla uncomfortable, and now she
found herself blushing for them all. The tide
of color flooded her smooth forehead and dyed
her throat. Peggy's observant eyes detected
an unmistakable shadow on Mr. Kennedy's erst-while
radiant face.</p>

<p>Later, when Graham and herself were alone,
she scolded him a little. "You oughtn't to have
said that a friend of mine had a case on Hitchcock.
Now Mr. Kennedy knows you meant
Priscilla."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, is that such a tragedy?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you mention to him some day that
Horace did admire Priscilla, but that now he's
safely married to another. You could bring it
in in a casual way, you know."</p>

<p>Graham looked at her hard. "My dear
Peggy," he said, "Just because you yourself
have been fortunate&mdash;unusually fortunate I
might say&mdash;in your love affairs, don't let that
lead you into trying your hand at matchmaking.
Fooling with high explosives is child's play
compared to that, believe me."</p>

<p>But instead of seeming impressed by the
warning, Peggy only answered dreamily,
"When he doesn't see Horace at the wedding,
he'll probably begin to suspect that it's ancient
history. If only Priscilla could learn to speak
of him without blushing."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>A MISSING BRIDE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was two days before Peggy's wedding,
and in the front room downstairs Peggy was
looking around complacently on her wedding
presents. They were very much like the wedding
presents of other prospective brides. A
few were admirably suited to the needs of a
young couple of moderate means, about to start
house-keeping. Others would have been useful
in the establishments of wealthy people who expected
to do a great deal of entertaining. And
there were still others whose use was problematical,
anywhere and under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Peggy's mood, however, was far from critical.
Each gift as it came had given her the keenest
pleasure, and if it were impossible to find anything
admirable in the article itself, she could
always say, "How awfully kind of them to send
it. Everybody's being perfectly dear to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
She approached every newly arrived package
with the same feeling with which she had once
taken up a bulging Christmas stocking.</p>

<p>The clock in the dining room, a pert little timepiece
with a peremptory voice, struck three.
It was characteristic of this particular clock
always to strike the hour as if it were reminding
somebody of something. On this occasion it
reminded Peggy that she had an engagement
with the dressmaker at half past three, and that
she was to call for Ruth, who had promised to
accompany her. As it was impossible to take
along a crowd of girls to the dressmaker's
rather cramped quarters, Peggy avoided hard
feeling by inviting a different girl each day.</p>

<p>Peggy had hardly reached the top of the
stairs when the bell rang, and Sally came rushing
from the kitchen to answer it. The prospect
of a wedding in the family had so excited
Sally that she was even less responsible for her
conduct than usual. Almost the only thing she
could be trusted to do was to answer the door-bell,
but as the bell rang very often, she succeeded
in making herself rather useful. On
this occasion a swarthy woman stood outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and in a quick, parrot-like fashion said something
Sally did not understand.</p>

<p>"You want to see Miss Peggy?" Sally demanded.
Such wits as she possessed were not
on duty, for ordinarily she would have
recognized the stranger's errand, and sent her
about her business. As the woman nodded,
Sally at once admitted her, showing her into
the room where the wedding presents stood
about in picturesque confusion.</p>

<p>"Miss Peggy," shrieked Sally, forgetting
for the moment the lesson impressed on her on
innumerable occasions that she was not to save
her steps by calling up the stairs, "Somebody
to see you."</p>

<p>It was a minute or two before Peggy came
down, and Sally had retreated to the kitchen
in the meantime. Peggy who had naturally
expected to see an acquaintance, was rather
startled to be confronted by a dark-skinned
woman with jet black eyes and an oily voice.</p>

<p>"Buy lace, lady? Very cheap: three inch
wide up to nine inch. Very cheap!"</p>

<p>Peggy replied politely that she did not care
for any lace, reflecting as she spoke that had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
woman presented herself a few months earlier,
she might have thought it worth while to examine
her stock. Having had some experience
in the persistence of her kind, she was surprised
when the dark woman took her refusal as final,
and meekly let herself out. Peggy stepped into
the kitchen to warn Sally against her late indiscretion,
and came back through the hall, reflecting
that she must hurry, since the dressmaker
did not like to be kept waiting. As she
passed the open door of the room the vender of
lace had so lately quitted, she stopped and stood
transfixed.</p>

<p>One of her wedding presents was missing.
She knew exactly the place where it had stood
on the center table, flanked on one side by a
pair of book-ends, and on the other by a cloisonné
vase. The gap left by its removal was
as obvious to Peggy's startled eyes as the
breach in a smile, due to a missing tooth. Instantly
she understood that there was no
mystery about its disappearance. She had seen
it not ten minutes before, and the only person
who had entered the room since then was the
woman with lace to sell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The discovery went to Peggy's head. The
stealing of any of her other possessions would
not have affected her in just the same way.
But these were her wedding presents, invested
with a certain sanctity because of the goodwill
they represented, and the occasion which led to
their bestowal. It never once occurred to
Peggy that she could submit to such an outrage.</p>

<p>She ran out of the house, looking up and down
the street, and immediately caught sight of the
woman she wanted. Apparently she had suspended
business for the day, for she was walking,
rapidly and making no attempt to dispose
of her wares in any of the houses she passed.
Peggy promptly started in pursuit. Her idea
was to follow the woman, keeping her in sight
until she could encounter a policeman. Peggy
had no desire to deprive any human creature,
however erring, of her liberty. She hoped the
officer of the law would force the surrender of
her ill-gotten gains without formally arresting
her. But whatever the consequences, she meant
to recover her property.</p>

<p>According to the calendar it was the last day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of June, but the thermometer proclaimed it
mid-July. The heated air quivered. The
streets seemed as silent as the thoroughfares
of a deserted village. A block from Peggy's
home, the woman took the right-hand turning
and went down Rossiter Street. Peggy followed,
walking rapidly in her determination to
gain on the quick-walking figure on ahead.</p>

<p>Three blocks on Rossiter Street, and then the
woman turned north, giving Peggy a clew to her
plan. Friendly Terrace lay near the outskirts
of the city. A walk of a mile from Peggy's
home brought one into a section sparsely
settled. It looked as though Peggy's quarry
were making for the open country.</p>

<p>Oh, for a policeman! Peggy rather unjustly
resented the scarcity of officers of the law, forgetting
how seldom their services were required
in the law-abiding part of town. She discovered,
too, that the woman pursued was uncannily
aware of her pursuer. Though apparently
she never looked back, she accommodated
her pace to Peggy's, accelerating her
speed, as Peggy quickened hers, so that the
distance between them remained about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
same in spite of Peggy's efforts to lessen it.</p>

<p>Owing to the lack of policemen, had any reliable
looking man passed her in a car, Peggy
believed herself capable of stopping him and
commandeering his services. But apparently
the heat had driven every one indoors. Two
or three delivery wagons passed with small
boys handling the reins. One machine glided
by, but the driver was a woman. After an
hour's chase the two participants in the singular
game of "Follow my Leader," came out
upon the turnpike, stretching away to the north,
white and dusty and hot in the brilliant sun.
Here the houses were scattered and stood back
from the road. The likelihood of encountering
a policeman had become extremely faint. But
Peggy set her teeth and pressed forward.</p>

<p>Graham got off half an hour early this
particular afternoon, and reached Peggy's a
little before five. Irma, dimpled and sweet, a
replica of Dorothy a few years earlier, rushed
to meet him squealing with delight, while
Dorothy smiled a welcome, her lips pinched
tightly together. One of Dorothy's upper
front teeth was missing and Dorothy was painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
conscious of the lack every minute that
she was awake.</p>

<p>Graham kissed his prospective nieces,
greeted the older members of the family
cordially, if less effusively, and put the inevitable
question, "Where's Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at the dressmaker's of course," sighed
Mrs. Raymond. "I hope she won't keep the
poor child very long. It's so dreadfully
warm."</p>

<p>The telephone tinkled, and Dick went to
answer it. He scowled as he listened. "Who
did you say it was? Oh, wait a minute!"
He turned to his mother. "I thought you said
Peggy had gone to the dressmaker's."</p>

<p>"She has. She had a fitting at half past
three."</p>

<p>"Well, this is the dressmaker, and she says
Peggy hasn't come."</p>

<p>"Let me speak to her." Mrs. Raymond
crossed to the phone, with an air of expecting
to clear up the puzzle immediately. And
hardly had she made herself known, when the
door opened and Ruth appeared. "What's become
of Peggy? She was to call for me a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
after three, and I've had my hat on waiting for
her nearly two hours."</p>

<p>What had become of Peggy? She had not
kept her engagement with the dressmaker, and
Ruth knew nothing of her whereabouts. Mrs.
Raymond called up Priscilla and Amy, each of
whom disavowed having seen Peggy since noon.
And then as there seemed nothing better to do,
she went on calling neighbors and friends and
trades-people, growing more and more puzzled,
moment by moment. For no one had seen
Peggy.</p>

<p>It finally occurred to Peggy's sister, Alice, to
make inquiries in the kitchen. Sally informed
her that Miss Peggy had come into the kitchen
with her hat on, and had said something about
the dressmaker. The new girl, who had been
engaged to help out for the few weeks before
the wedding, confirmed Sally's story, adding
that it was a little after three when Peggy left
the house. Obviously Peggy had started out
with the intention of keeping her appointment,
and obviously she had not done so.</p>

<p>Dinner was ready at six o'clock, but no one
was ready for dinner. Peggy's failure to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
at meal-time added to the general consternation.
Peggy was by nature prompt and
methodical, and she had acted the rôle of cook
too often not to realize how the best efforts of
that important functionary are frustrated by
late arrivals. At quarter past six Mr. Raymond
went to the telephone and called up the
hospitals one after another. But the hot
sleepy day had not been productive of automobile
accidents, and the only cases of sun-strokes
reported were elderly people, four men
and one old woman.</p>

<p>Graham was very pale. A dreadful suspicion
was taking shape in his mind. Could it
be that, as the second of July drew near, Peggy
had found herself unable to face the situation?
Perhaps he had asked too much of her when he
had urged her accompanying him to South
America. He thought of the innumerable ties
that bound her to her native land, and yet he
had assumed that she would be ready to leave
everything and every one she loved, and go
with him to a land of strangers. Graham was
no more troubled by excessive humility than
other popular young men, but in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
emergency he seemed to himself to have put a
most preposterous estimate on the value of his
own society. He had a horrible conviction
that, through his demanding too much, Peggy
was lost to him forever.</p>

<p>It hardly need be said that no one in the anxious
company shared this particular apprehension.
At seven o'clock Peggy's father made
up his mind that it would be necessary to appeal
to the police. But before he could bring
himself to act on this conviction, the gate
clicked and Irma, standing at the window, her
nose flattened against the screen, exploded in
a series of joyful shrieks.</p>

<p>"Aunt Peggy! Aunt Peggy! Oh, it's Aunt
Peggy!"</p>

<p>And Peggy it was, though it took a second
glance to be sure. The perspiration trickling
over her dusty face had produced a curious
piebald effect, and she walked with a noticeable
limp. They rushed to the door, greeting
her with mingled cries of joy and reproach.
All but Graham. He sat down in the darkest
corner of the living room and put his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
over his face. The intensity of his relief was
almost too much for him.</p>

<p>Peggy limped in, looking decidedly ashamed
of herself.</p>

<p>"Have you waited dinner for me? I'm
awfully sorry."</p>

<p>"Waited dinner," repeated Mrs. Raymond,
and burst into tears. Peggy's sister Alice
caught her by the shoulders and gave her a
sharp little shake.</p>

<p>"Peggy Raymond, where have you been and
what have you been doing? Don't you understand
that we've been frightened to death
about you?"</p>

<p>Peggy dropped into the nearest chair and
began on her story. She told of the woman
Sally had admitted to the house, the missing
wedding present, and the purpose with which
she had started in pursuit. They all listened
breathlessly, Graham left his corner and stood
back of the others, unwilling to miss a word.</p>

<p>It was not till Peggy's recital brought her to
the turnpike that she lost a little of her fluency.
At this point she hesitated and seemed to appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the difficulty of making matters clear
to her audience. "Of course I should have
given up then. But somehow I couldn't. I
kept hoping that somebody would appear, and
it seemed such a shame when I'd followed that
thief so far, to give up and go back. I'd made
up my mind that as soon as an automobile came
along, I'd ask for a lift. I felt if I could only
catch up with her I could frighten her into
giving me what belonged to me. But nobody
passed me, and then when she got to the old
toll-gate&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond interrupted, "You don't
mean you followed her to the toll gate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father. Or at least I was almost there.
You know there's a cross-road just beyond the
gate, and a Ford car came up that cross-road
and turned north on the pike. And the woman
stopped it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confederates, I'll bet," cried Dick.</p>

<p>"No, it looked as if she were just asking
some stranger for a ride. And as far as they
knew she was only a tired woman carrying a
bag and they took her in. And then I saw it
wasn't any use to go further."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"You surprise me." Mr. Raymond's voice
was satirical. "I can't understand why you
didn't run after the machine."</p>

<p>Peggy accepted the sarcastic rejoinder
meekly. "Then I turned around and came
home. But you see I had put on my new brown
shoes because Mrs. Morley wanted to fit my
brown dress with the shoes I was going to
wear with it, and all at once they began to hurt
me terribly. Instead of hurrying I had to
slow up, and sometimes I had to stop and wait.
I never had anything hurt so."</p>

<p>"If you'd walked three blocks east," exclaimed
Graham, speaking for the first time,
"you could have got a car."</p>

<p>"I knew it, but I'd come off without my
pocket book. I didn't have a penny with me.
That was the reason I didn't telephone."</p>

<p>Peggy looked about her with a crestfallen
air. While she was far from realizing the extent
of the alarm her family had felt, and
would not have believed Graham had he told
her of the apprehensions that had tortured
him through the terrible time of waiting, she
understood that they had all been worried and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that she had inconvenienced every one by
making dinner late. "Don't wait for me any
longer," she pleaded. "Have the dinner put
on, mother, and I'll be down as soon as I've
washed up a little."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond put her arm about her.
"Yes, come upstairs, darling. You must have
something on those blisters right away. Alice,
tell Sally to put on plates for Ruth and
Graham."</p>

<p>It was while they were eating lamb chops,
which after an hour and a half in the warming
oven might as well have been anything else,
that some one thought to put the question
Peggy had been dreading. "Do you know
what present she stole?"</p>

<p>Peggy took a hasty sip of her iced tea and
looked appealingly at her questioner. But her
reluctant manner only aroused the curiosity of
every one.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it was the silver teapot," exclaimed
Dick.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what's missing, as long
as Peggy herself is here safe and sound," declared
Mrs. Raymond fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what <i>did</i> she take?" insisted Alice,
eyeing her sister with suspicion.</p>

<p>Again Peggy forfeited herself with iced tea,
and her cheeks, flushed by heat and weariness,
took on a deeper hue. "It&mdash;it really wasn't so
valuable,&mdash;" stammered Peggy. "You know
Elvira Bond gave me half a dozen teaspoons
that she got by saving soap wrappers or something.
They came in a neat little case, and I
suppose the woman snatched the nearest
thing without looking. I didn't chase her
because the spoons were worth so much
because&mdash;well, it was the principle of the
thing."</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence, and then
a roar of laughter. They laughed long and
helplessly and wiped their eyes and started all
over again. As a rule Peggy could appreciate
a joke, even if it was against herself, but on
this occasion a rather wry smile was the best
she could do. She was beginning to realize
that she had been very silly.</p>

<p>"Well, Graham," remarked Mr. Raymond
when he could make himself heard, "In my
opinion you're assuming quite a responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in planning to take this young woman to South
America."</p>

<p>Graham's eyes met Peggy's and something
in his look arrested her attention, a peculiar
radiance as if he had just heard a wonderful
piece of news. But all he said was, "I'm
ready to take the risk, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>A JULY WEDDING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peggy's</span> brother Dick had parodied an old
rhyme to fit the occasion and sang it with gusto,
in season and out of season. It was Dick's
voice, caroling in a high falsetto, and breaking
ludicrously on an average of once a line, that
woke Peggy on the most eventful morning of
her life.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A wedding day in May<br />
Is worth a load of hay.<br />
A wedding set for June<br />
Is worth a silver spoon.<br />
A wedding in July<br />
Isn't worth a fly."<br />
</div>

<p>Peggy winked hard and sat up in bed, turning
instantly toward the east windows. "Oh," she
cried joyously, "what a glorious day!" And
so indeed it was. Apparently the weather
man had carefully selected whatever was best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in all the year, and combined his selections into
one perfect day in honor of Peggy's wedding.
There had been a little rain the night before, and
the air was as sweet as if perfumed by June's
roses. There was a freshness that suggested
early spring, and something in the breeze as
exhilarating as October. Peggy reflected complacently
that this was just her luck.</p>

<p>She wondered, as she dressed, what she was to
do with herself between the hours of eight and
six. Her trunk was packed for going away,
and the other trunks were ready except for a
few articles to be added at the last minute.
She had acknowledged every gift she had received.
The dressmaker was through with her,
and the wedding dress was hanging in Peggy's
closet, with a sheet draped over it that no
speck of dust should mar its immaculate whiteness.
Peggy decided that her wedding day
was to be characterized by elegant leisure.</p>

<p>Of course this expectation was not realized.
To begin with, there were more presents.
They came by parcels post and by express.
Deliverymen handed them over as nonchalantly
as if they had been ordinary purchases. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
came by special messengers, who grinned
knowingly when Peggy signed for them.
Breakfast was hardly over when it was
necessary to send for Graham, that he might
assist in opening the packages. But Graham
was not as satisfactory in opening packages as
a number of other people, Priscilla and Amy,
for instance. If Peggy cried "Isn't that
beautiful?" he always looked straight at her
as he said "yes," and then it was necessary to
remind him that he was supposed to be
admiring a piece of silverware or glass.
Peggy always said, "How beautiful!" when a
package was opened. And then if the article
were something she really wanted, she would
add, "Isn't it lucky, Graham, that some one
thought of that? I don't see how we could
have kept house without it." And if it were
something quite unsuitable she would cry,
"How kind everybody is. I never saw anything
like it."</p>

<p>The present from Peggy's college class came
the morning of the wedding day, when it was
practically certain that no one was to be
married in advance of Peggy. It was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
attractive silver vase, with the class motto engraved
about its base. Peggy's delight was
marred by one characteristic reflection. "I
have so many things. It's almost a pity this
didn't go to some girl whose friends weren't
so generous."</p>

<p>"Any one could have had it," Graham reminded
her, "who was ready to take the risk.
This is in recognition of your courage, like the
Victoria Cross."</p>

<p>Of course the wedding presents were not
going to South America, but were to be stored
against the young people's return. "Don't
you hate to go away and leave all these lovely
things, Graham?" Peggy asked, stroking the
gleaming sides of a copper bowl as if it had
been a kitten. And then with her usual happy
faculty for seeing the bright side, she added,
"But think of coming home and finding them
waiting for us! Why, it'll be like getting
married all over again."</p>

<p>Wedding presents, however, were not to occupy
Peggy's thoughts to the exclusion of
other matters. All sorts of affectionate
messages kept coming, special deliveries, telegrams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
telephone calls. A girl like Peggy,
who for twenty-one years and over has been
helping to make the world a happier place, is
likely to be surprised when she comes to count
up her friends. Elaine Marshall, who had
moved from the city and now lived with her
married sister, came down for the day. "I
couldn't stand it, not to be at your wedding,
Peggy," she declared. And Lucy Haines
walked in about noon, looking so radiant that
Peggy at once suspected an especial reason.
There was a little pearl ring on the third finger
of Lucy's left hand that Peggy had never seen
before. Lucy blushed when she saw Peggy's
contemplative gaze focused on it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peggy, it's&mdash;it's Jerry," owned Lucy,
looking so proud and happy that she did not
seem even distantly related to the disheartened
girl who had once thought it was no use trying.
"He's grown into such a splendid fellow.
Everybody says I'm so lucky. And, Peggy, if
it hadn't been for the summer you spent at
Doolittle Cottage, it's not likely that either of
us would ever have amounted to anything."</p>

<p>Mary Donaldson called up to say that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
was coming to the wedding. Her father and
cousin had promised to carry her downstairs,
and they were going early so she could be in
her place before any one else arrived. "I
don't believe you're a bit more excited than I
am, Peggy," Mary laughed. And another
surprise was when Uncle Philander and his
wife drove into town, with a bushel or two of
flowers piled about them in the buggy.</p>

<p>"They're not such awful stylish flowers,"
beamed Aunt Phoebe. "Of course there's a
few roses, but most of our bushes bloomed themselves
'most to death in June and haven't done
much since. The rest are just everyday posies,
so to speak, but they'll make little bright spots
around the house, and anyway, you can't have
too many flowers at a wedding."</p>

<p>At four o'clock the bridesmaids went home
to dress. The mother of the flower girl
pounced on her and carried her upstairs.</p>

<p>"Peggy, dear," said Mrs. Raymond warningly.</p>

<p>"Just a minute mother. I want to tell
Graham something." Peggy led her lover into
a corner and whispered in his ear, "Don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
want to come back and get a glimpse of me
after I'm dressed."</p>

<p>"Well rather."</p>

<p>"Because you know, if you don't like me,"
dimpled Peggy, "it's not too late to change
your mind." She was inclined to be reproachful
when Graham caught her in his arms and
kissed her before everybody, but Graham insisted
it was her own fault, and on reflection
Peggy decided he was right.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the little church was well filled.
In spite of Graham's teasing, Peggy's humble
friends could hardly be distinguished from
their so-called betters. Hildegarde Carey,
slender and elegant, sat in the pew behind
Elvira Bond, and noticed nothing peculiar except
that Elvira blew her nose oftener and with
more emphasis than is customary on such occasions.
It was either that or weep, and
Elvira chose the least of the two evils. As for
Jimmy Dunn, with his purple necktie and a
large scarfpin that resembled a diamond, he
was fairly resplendent.</p>

<p>The march pealed out and the people rose.
Up the aisle came the bridesmaids walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
very slowly. The little flower girl, all smiles,
seemed as unconscious as if weddings were an
old story in her experience. And then came
Peggy on her father's arm, and Elvira Bond
was not the only one whose eyes brimmed over
as she passed.</p>

<p>A great deal can happen in five minutes.
The organ pealed out again, and now Peggy
was Mrs. Graham Wylie. She put her hand on
her husband's arm and smiled up into his face,
Peggy's own sunny smile. She had promised
for better or for worse, but in her heart of
hearts she was confident that the future held
only good for the two of them. And as
Graham was equally positive on that score,
they went down the aisle with illumined faces.</p>

<p>Only a few besides the two families came to
the house from the church. These, with the
out-of-town guests like Elaine and Lucy, and
the wedding party, filled the cosy little house to
overflowing. Mary Donaldson sat in a corner,
radiant; and since she could not cross the
room to kiss the bride, the bride crossed to
kiss her.</p>

<p>It was after the chicken salad had been disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of, and they were passing the ice cream,
that Peggy's attention focussed itself on her
new friend, Mr. Kennedy. He stood by himself
for the moment and his face was rather
grave for a young man, a guest at a wedding.
But as he caught her eye, he smiled resolutely
and came over to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you're going away, Mrs. Wylie,
just as I met you. It doesn't seem fair."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, too," said Peggy. "If we'd
only known that night at the Green Parrot that
you were a friend of Graham's it would have
simplified matters so much."</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy's face again lost its smile. He
turned and looked the company over. "Your
friend Hitchcock isn't here to-night, is he?"</p>

<p>Peggy was delighted. She had been wishing
for a chance to bring Horace into the conversation,
and here Mr. Kennedy had done it himself.
When again the young man looked at her,
he was almost startled by the radiant mischief
of her face.</p>

<p>"Horace Hitchcock here? Oh, dear, no! I
can't think of anybody I'd be less likely to ask
to my wedding."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's one point, evidently, on which you
and Miss Combs are not in agreement."</p>

<p>Peggy pondered. "Priscilla might ask him
to her wedding. I don't know. But it's
certain he didn't ask <i>her</i> to <i>his</i>."</p>

<p>Young Mr. Kennedy's start was unmistakable.
"You don't mean he's married?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed. There was quite an account
of it in the papers. But if you didn't know
his name, you wouldn't remember."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't remember," agreed Mr.
Kennedy. All at once he was beaming. "I
shall be glad when the next two years are up,
Mrs. Wylie," he cried boyishly. "I have a
hunch that you and I are going to be great
friends."</p>

<p>A moment later he joined Priscilla, and from
that time on followed her about like her
shadow, and the observant Peggy smiled approval.
She was not in the least discomfited
by Graham's reference to high explosives.
The most dangerous things in the world, in her
estimation, were misunderstandings.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the bride went upstairs to
change to her little going-away suit with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Eton Jacket, that made her look hardly older
than the Peggy Raymond who entered college.
And then the good-bys began. "We'll be back
in a few days," said Peggy as she kissed each
one, but even that assurance failed to give comfort.
For though Peggy and Graham were
coming back for twenty-four hours, they were
to sail on the sixth. Peggy's friends returned
her smiles bravely, but there was hardly one
who did not struggle to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>They crowded out on the porch to see her go.
Some one hurled an old shoe as the taxi-cab
glided away. Peggy leaned from the window
to wave her hand, and then the darkness
swallowed her up.</p>

<p>Amy, Ruth, and Priscilla stood side by side.
The tears were running down Ruth's cheeks,
and Priscilla's eyes were wet. Amy had
forced herself to smile during Peggy's protracted
leave-taking and the smile persisted,
though it had become a grimace.</p>

<p>"Is this place called Friendly Terrace?"
Amy demanded tragically, "Or is it the&mdash;the
Dismal Swamp."</p>

<p>"Or the desert of Sahara," suggested Priscilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a quaver in her voice showing that the
suggestion was not altogether a joke.</p>

<p>"Girls!" for a moment Ruth struggled with
a sob, but she conquered it and went on resolutely,
"I don't know who named Friendly
Terrace, but I do know it was Peggy who made
the name fit. And we've got to keep it up.
We can't let it become like other little streets
where nobody cares for his neighbor. We've
got to show what Peggy meant to us by&mdash;by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By keeping the home fires burning," interpolated
Amy, and Ruth nodded as if the familiar
phrase said all she had wished to say.</p>

<p>As the others crowded indoors, declaring
after immemorial fashion that there had never
been a prettier wedding nor a lovelier bride,
Peggy's three friends stood side by side;
Ruth's hand was fast in Amy's, and Amy's
arm was about Priscilla's waist. And while
none of them spoke, each of them in her heart
was silently pledging herself to keep Friendly
Terrace what Peggy had made it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Robinson's</span> distinguished success came with the
acclaim accredited to his novel, SMILES, "<i>The Best-Loved
Book of the Year</i>," and its sequel, SMILING
PASS. With delicate humor and a sincere faith in the
beautiful side of human nature, Mr. Robinson has
created for himself a host of enthusiastic admirers.
In his new book he chooses a theme, suggested perhaps
by the old proverb quoted above ("Pilpay's Fables").
His setting is a Quaker village, his theme the conflict
between grave Quaker ideals and the strength and hot
blood of impulsive Mark Gray.</p>

<p>Here is a book that is worthy of the reception accorded
SMILES by all readers who appreciate a story
of deep significance, simply yet powerfully built upon
fundamental passions, wrought with a philosophy that
always sees the best in troubled times.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic editor who passed on MARK
GRAY'S HERITAGE calls it&mdash;hardly too emphatically&mdash;"A
mighty good story with plenty of entertainment
for those who like action (there is more of that
in it than in any other of Mr. Robinson's novels). The
reading public will unquestionably call it another 'courage
book'&mdash;which they called the SMILES books, you
know. The language is both strong and smooth. The
story has a punch!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel Anderson</span>, who heretofore has confined her
literary talents to writing of presidents and diplomats
and fascinating foreign lands, contributes to our list
her first novel, POLLY THE PAGAN, a story of
European life and "high society." The story is unfolded
in the lively letters of a gay and vivacious American
girl traveling in Europe, and tells of the men
whom she meets in Paris, in London or Rome, her
flirtations (and they are many and varied!) and exciting
experiences. Among the letters written to her are
slangy ones from an American college boy and some
in broken English from a fascinated Russian Prince
(or was he disillusioned, when after dining at a smart
Parisian café with the adorable Polly he was trapped
by secret police?); but the chief interest, so far as
Polly's <i>affaires d'amour</i> are concerned, centers around
the letters from a young American, in the diplomatic
service in Rome, who is in a position to give intimate
descriptions of smart life and Italian society.</p>

<p>The character drawing is clever, and the suspense as
to whom the fascinating Polly will marry, if indeed the
mysterious young lady will marry anybody, is admirably
sustained.</p>

UNCLE MARY.<br />
</div>

<p>Here is a story, charming in its New England village
setting, endearing in its characters, engrossing in its
plot, and diverting in its style. The PAGE imprint
has been given to many books about beautiful characters

"Uncle" Mary's protégé, Libbie Lee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mullins is an author gifted with the ability to
appeal to the young in heart of whatever age. Her
characters are visually portrayed. Her situations have
the interest of naturalness and suspense. The reader
of UNCLE MARY will become in spirit an inhabitant
of Sunfield; will understand the enjoyment of the sudden
acquisition of wealth, a limousine, and&mdash;an adopted
child (!), by the sisters, "Uncle" Mary and "Aunt"
Alice; will watch with interest the thawing and rejuvenation
of "Uncle" Mary, the cure of Alice, and the

and strangeness of India&mdash;poison and daggers,
the impassive faces and fierce hearts of Prince Bardai
and his priestly adviser; a typical English week-end

<p>And the plot! Who is the mysterious Red Cavalier?
Is he the ghost of the ancestral portrait, that hangs in
Sir Robert Grainger's strange library? Is he flesh and

murder? Or is it only coincidence that one of the

<p>There is Lady Berenice Coningsby, a bit <i>déclassé</i>;
Ethelyn Roydon, more so; Princess Lona Bardai, "Little
